  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The single aim in telling the story that follows is
to interest boys in the life of Booker T. Washington.</p>

<p class='c007'>This man’s life was of such singular and vital
importance in the history of his own race and in
the history of our country that it ought to be
familiar to all the youth of the land, and to the
negro youth especially, since it is the greatest
inspiration to the latter to be found in the annals
of American history.</p>

<p class='c007'>There has been no attempt to be original or
exhaustive in the treatment. While a great mass
of material has been consulted, it should be frankly
stated that the story follows very closely the
material found in Washington’s “Up from Slavery”
and “My Larger Education” and Scott and
Stowe’s “Booker T. Washington: Builder of a
Civilization.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The author desires to acknowledge his indebtedness
to Doubleday, Page and Company for permission
to use extensive quotations from these books.</p>

<p class='c007'>If some boy by reading this book is inspired to
higher ambition and encouraged to nobler effort,
the author will feel that the book is fully justified.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This is the story of Booker T. Washington.
It is the story of a boy who was born a slave and
who in manhood became the leader of ten million
people; who was born in poverty and ignorance
and became the greatest orator and teacher of
the negro race; who was born of an ignorant and
backward race and became the friend of the
greatest and best men of all races of all the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a brave man. He had courage and
backbone. He was not afraid. He had courage
to fight for what he believed to be the right.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was an energetic man. There was not a lazy
bone in him. No man ever lived a more strenuous
life than he did. He loved his work; and few
other men ever did so much work in a lifetime.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was just and fair-minded. He could see right
for the white man as well as for the negro. He
never intentionally did any one, white or black,
an injustice.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was an honest man; honest in his thinking
as well as in his business; honest, frank, and open
in his speeches and his writings. He looked facts
squarely in the face.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a wise man. He had intelligence. He
had good judgment. He knew the right thing to
do and to say, and he did it and said it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>He was a modest man. He did not boast or
brag. He did not try to get money or office or
high position. He was content to do his work as
an honest man.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a patriotic man. He loved his country and
believed this to be the greatest nation in the world;
and he was ready to give his life for it if necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had will power. He made up his mind about
things, and, when he had made a decision, he could
not be discouraged nor turned aside. He would
see his plans through, and he would stand by his
convictions to the last.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had self-control. He did not lose his temper
or his tongue. He kept himself in hand. He did
not lose his head or waste his time and thought
and effort on useless and needless things.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a great lover of animals. He loved the
pigs and the chickens, the horses and the dogs, the
birds and the fishes, and every living thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Above all he loved folks. He loved the people
of all races. He was a friend not only to the black
man but likewise a friend to the red man, the yellow,
the brown, and the white.</p>

<p class='c007'>He loved his race. He was not ashamed of it.
He was proud of its history; of its great achievements
in the past. He had an abounding confidence
in its future. He believed that in the days
that lie ahead the negro race is to play a wonderful
part.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well worth while to know about this man.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>No state in the Union has a more interesting
history than Virginia. It is the oldest of the
states. It was at Jamestown in 1607 that the
first permanent English settlement was made in
America. Before the Revolution, it shared with
Massachusetts the honor of being the leading
colony. During the time of the Revolution, it
furnished some of America’s greatest leaders—Washington,
Patrick Henry, and Thomas Jefferson.
After the Revolution, it became known as the
“Mother of Presidents.” Most of the battles of
the Civil War were fought on its soil, and its capital
was the capital of the Confederacy. Lee and
Jackson, the two greatest leaders of the Confederacy,
were Virginians.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was in this state that slavery in North America
began. We must remember, however, that slavery
had been in existence a long, long time. The
ancient Hebrews, we are told in the Old Testament,
practiced this evil custom. So did all the nations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>about Palestine. The Greeks and the Romans
also kept slaves. We must not think of the
people that were enslaved by the Hebrews and
Greeks and Romans as negroes. They were of all
races. Whenever one people conquered another,
it mattered not of what race, the conquerors made
their captives slaves. This often resulted in the
most cultured and highly educated people being
made slaves. This was especially the case when
the Romans captured Greeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later on in the history of Europe, during the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the enslavement
of negroes became very general, so that,
by the time North America began to be settled
by the people from Europe, negro slaves were
bought and sold throughout the principal European
countries and their colonies.</p>

<p class='c007'>So it came about that, in Virginia, negro slavery
was introduced into the United States. It was in
1619 that a Dutch ship, after a cruise in the West
Indies, landed at Jamestown, and while there,
engaging in trade with the inhabitants, sold them
nineteen negroes. These were the first slaves sold
in North America, and it was from this beginning
that the system grew up in the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Virginia too we had the first big plantations.
Tobacco was the most important crop in the early
history of the colony. The planters could sell
tobacco at a great profit in England. Negro
slaves could cultivate tobacco very successfully.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>The planters, therefore, bought slaves to raise
tobacco, and they sold the tobacco and bought
more slaves to raise more tobacco. The planters
bought many hundreds of acres of land and many
slaves to cultivate them. As you know, the slaves
lived in cabins. These cabins were little houses,
usually built of logs, and the cracks were daubed
with mud. The cabin usually had one door, one
window, and a dirt floor only. These cabins were
all close together, not very far from the “big
house,” and were known as the “quarters.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The slaves did all the work on the plantation.
Most of them worked in the fields. Some worked
about the barn and in the garden. One drove the
master’s carriage and took care of the horses.
Another was the butler in the “big house.” Some
of the small boys and girls also worked in the
“big house,” serving their young masters and
mistresses. And, of course, one of the negro women
was the plantation cook.</p>

<p class='c007'>On just such a plantation down in Franklin
County, Virginia, Booker T. Washington was
born. His mother was the cook on the plantation
of a Mr. Burroughs who lived near a little crossroads
post office, southwest of Lynchburg, called
Hales’ Ford. There, in a little one-room cabin,
Booker was born on April 5, 1856. The cabin
had no glass windows. It had only one door,
and it had a dirt floor. There were large cracks
that let in the cold. In the middle of the floor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>there was a large opening in the ground in which
sweet potatoes were stored. Sometimes as they
put the potatoes in or took them out, Booker got
one or two and roasted them. All of the cooking
was done over the open fire in this cabin, for they
had no stove. It was a very uncomfortable place
in which to live.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boy lived a hard life. He says: “I cannot
remember a single instance during my childhood
or early boyhood when our entire family sat down
to the table together, and God’s blessing was asked,
and the family ate a meal in a civilized manner.
It was a piece of bread here, and a scrap of meat
there. It was a cup of milk at one time and some
potatoes at another.”<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>One day, when he was about five years old, he
saw his young mistress and some visitors out in
the yard eating ginger cakes. He said he never
saw anything in his life that looked so good to him
as those cakes did; and he thought that, if he ever
got free, the height of his ambition would be to
buy all the ginger cakes he wanted, just like those
the young ladies were eating.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had to sleep on a pallet. He never slept
in a bed until after he was set free. The first pair
of shoes he ever had was made of leather, but the
soles were of wood, and they were very uncomfortable
and made a great noise when he walked.
He never thought of wearing anything on his head.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>But the worst thing about his dress in those early days
was having to wear a flax shirt. These shirts
were made of the roughest and coarsest part of the
flax, and they were very uncomfortable. When
new, they scratched severely. After they were
worn awhile and “broken in,” they were fairly
comfortable. His brother John often “broke in”
Booker’s shirts for him, a very kind and generous
thing to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had no time to play when he was a boy.
When he was a grown man, he was asked what
games he played when he was a boy, and he
answered that he had never played at all. He had
to work so hard that no time was left for play.
Even when he was a very small boy, he had to
sweep the yards, carry water to the hands in the
fields, help around the “big house,” and carry in
wood. Going to mill was the worst job he had.
A farm hand would put a sack of corn on a horse,
put him on top of the sack, and send him off. It
was a long way to the mill. Almost every time
he was sent, the sack of corn would work to one
side and then fall off. It was too heavy for him to
put back; so he would have to wait until some
one came along to help him. He sat and cried until
some one came. It was often dark when he got
home. He was terribly frightened when he was
alone at night, for he was told that there were
deserting soldiers in the woods, and that when
they found little negro boys the first thing they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>would do would be to cut off their ears. Of course
this was not true, but he thought it was.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you suppose this little boy had any chance
to go to school? This is what he says: “I had no
schooling whatever while I was a slave, though I
remember on several occasions I went as far as
the schoolhouse door with one of my young mistresses
to carry her books. The picture of several
boys and girls in a schoolroom engaged in study
made a deep impression upon me, and I had the
feeling that to get into a schoolhouse and study
in this way would be about the same as getting
into paradise.”<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> This is the same boy who came
to be the greatest educator of his race; the head
of the greatest negro school in the world.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>It must be remembered that the conditions
under which Booker lived in these early years of
his life were not restricted entirely to the negroes.
Many of the white people were poor also, and many
white boys wore flax shirts and shoes with wooden
soles. Just after the Civil War, especially, all
the white people of the South had a very hard time.
White boys as well as negro boys had no time for
play. Nor did they have an opportunity to go to
school. In those days many white boys who were
eager for an education had such difficulties to face
as those which loomed up before Booker Washington.</p>

<p class='c007'>By and by, when Booker was about nine years
of age, there came a thrilling day. For four long
years the great war had been going on. Often he
had heard his mother singing freedom songs. He
remembered being awakened one morning and
saw his mother by his bed and heard her praying
that Lincoln might be successful, and that her
little boy might some day be free. He had seen
some of the soldiers in their uniforms, home on
furlough. He remembered when they brought
home the body of “Marse Billy” and buried him
amidst the bitter weeping of the slaves, who loved
him as their friend, for he had often begged for
them when they were about to be punished. While
they vaguely knew and felt that the success of
Lincoln meant freedom, and the success of the
others meant slavery, they were still loyal and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>true to their masters. By means of the “grape
vine telegraph,” that is, by passing news along
quickly from one plantation to another, the slaves
had kept pretty well informed of the progress of
the war, and when Lee surrendered at Appomattox,
the slaves knew it very soon.</p>

<p class='c007'>One night word came to the “quarters” that
something very unusual would happen at the “big
house” the next day. There was much excitement.
Nobody slept that night. Early next
morning some one came to the quarters and told
the negroes that they were all wanted at the house.
Booker’s mother called her children, and they with
all the other slaves marched up to the house. All
the members of the family were on the porch.
They were very quiet and seemed sad and depressed.
There was present a stranger, a man who
wore a uniform. He stood up and read a paper—“The
Emancipation Proclamation.” Then the
master explained that the negroes were now free.
He told them that they could go wherever they
desired. He also told them that they could live
where they were if they wanted to, and they would
be taken care of; but if they preferred, they could
go to any other place. Booker’s mother leaned
over her children and kissed them while the tears
streamed down her face. Her prayers had been
answered. Her children were free.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br> <span class='c012'>BOYHOOD DAYS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When the slaves were set free, one of the first
things that many of them did was to change their
names. Most of the slaves had only one name.
As free people they felt that they should have the
same sort of names as other free people; so they
began to add a last name, and usually an initial.
If a man had been called “Tom” all his life, he
was now called “Tom L. Johnson.” The “L”
stood for nothing. It was simply a part of his
“entitles,” as Washington says. Another thing
they did was to leave their old home place. They
could not realize that they were really free unless
they tested the matter by going away from the
place of their servitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>Booker Washington’s stepfather had left Virginia
during the war and had gone to West Virginia.
Just as soon as the war was over, he sent
for his wife and children to come to him in West
Virginia.</p>

<p class='c007'>He lived at Malden, five miles from Charleston,
the capital of the state. It was several hundred
miles from the old home in Virginia, but the
family determined to go. They bundled up their
goods and put them in a cart, the children walking.
They traveled the entire distance in this way.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>They would stop by the roadside to do their cooking
and to camp at night.</p>

<p class='c007'>One night they stopped near an empty cabin.
They decided to spend the night in the cabin.
They went in and built a fire and spread a pallet
on the floor. Suddenly a big black snake rolled
down out of the chimney and on to the pallet.
You can imagine that they did not care to stay
longer in that house. They got outside at once
and made a camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>After several weeks, they completed their journey,
and the family reached the town of Malden.
Salt was mined there, and Booker’s stepfather
worked in the salt furnaces. Small as he was,
Booker had to begin this work too. It was very
hard work, and it was terrible that this child
should be compelled to do it. But it was just like
Booker to turn the situation to an advantage.
The first thing he ever did in the way of reading
was to learn the figure “18,” which was the number
put on the barrels of salt made by his father.
Booker was anxious to learn to read; but he had
no one to teach him. His own mother could not
even teach him his letters. She bought him an
old Webster’s “blue-back” speller, and he began
his first study in this book.</p>

<p class='c007'>About this time a private school was established
in the community. Booker was greatly excited
over this, for he had an overwhelming desire to go
to school. He was a good worker, however, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>was earning money; so his father said “no,” and
he could not go. Booker was terribly disappointed.
He went on with his work with a heavy heart,
but he never missed a chance to urge his stepfather
to let him go to school. Finally, his father
agreed to let him go for a part of the day, provided
he would get up early each morning and work
until nine o’clock and then work two hours after
school was out.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a glorious day for him when he found
himself going to school. However, he soon encountered
two great difficulties. One was that he
did not have a hat. He had never worn a hat or
cap in his life. Since all the other boys had them,
he felt that he must have one. So he went home
and told his mother about the situation. She
explained to him that she had no money with
which to buy a “store” hat, but she got two old
pieces of “homespun” or jeans, and sewed them
together for a cap. The next day Booker proudly
walked to school with one difficulty solved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Listen to his own story of his second difficulty:
“My second difficulty was with regard to my
name, or rather a name. From the time I could
remember anything I had been called simply
‘Booker.’ Before going to school it had never
occurred to me that it was needful or appropriate
to have an additional name.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When I heard the school roll called, I noticed
that all the children had at least two names, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>some of them indulged in what seemed to me the
extravagance of having three. I was in deep perplexity,
because I knew that the teacher would
demand of me at least two names, and I had only
one. By the time the occasion came for the enrolling
of my name, an idea occurred to me which
I thought would make me equal to the situation;
and so, when the teacher asked me what my full
name was, I calmly told him ‘Booker Washington,’
as if I had been called by that name all my
life; and by that name I have since been known.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Later in my life I found that my mother had
given me the name of ‘Booker Taliaferro’ (pronounced
Tol-li-ver) soon after I was born, but in
some way that part of my name seemed to disappear,
and for a long while was forgotten, but as
soon as I found out about it, I revived it and made
my full name ‘Booker Taliaferro Washington.’
I think there are not many men in our country
who have had the privilege of naming themselves
in the way that I have.”<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Booker was not permitted to go to school very
long. His stepfather put him back to work but he
went to school at night for a while. Here he learned
how valuable the nighttime was, and he afterwards
used it a great deal in teaching others.</p>

<p class='c007'>Near Malden was a coal mine. This business
became prosperous, and Booker was sent to work
in the coal mines. He hated this work worse than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>any he ever did. The work was very dirty. It
was pitch dark in the mines. It was also very
dangerous, for they used dynamite to blast out
the coal. His work was a mile from the entrance
of the mine. Furthermore, there were many big
rats in the place. Because there were many large
chambers to the mine and he never could learn all
of them, he often got lost. Then his light would
go out, and sometimes he would have to wait for
hours for some one to come to his aid. This was
terrible work for a boy only ten or twelve years
of age.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III<br> <span class='c012'>PLANNING FOR AN EDUCATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Later in life Washington said: “There was never
a time in my youth, no matter how dark and discouraging
the days might be, when one resolve did
not continually remain with me, and that was to
secure an education at any cost.”<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This was the thought that was in his mind as he
toiled from day to day in the dark and dirty coal
mine. He had never heard of any school except
the little one he had attended for a short time in
Malden. But he was sure that somewhere and
in some way he would find a place that would give
him what he so much desired.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, while digging away in the mine, he
heard a miner say something to another about a
big school for negroes. He was greatly excited
and on his hands and feet he crept through the
dark, as close to the two men as he dared, and
listened. They kept on talking and Booker heard
a conversation something like this: “I wish my
boy could go to that school over in Virginia,” said
one miner. “They say it is the best school anywhere
in the country.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What school are you talking about?” said the
other.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“The one at a place called Hampton, over in
Virginia,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, suppose there is a good school there;
negro boys can’t go to it, can they?” was asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, they can,” said the other. “It is a school
just for negro boys and girls, and they teach the
boys and girls something besides books, too. They
are taught some useful trades so that they can go
out and make a good living and be independent
and have pleasant work to do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said the other miner, “that sounds
pretty good, but nobody but rich folks can afford
such a school as that; so I don’t see where it is
going to help us any.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is where you are mistaken again,” was
the answer, “for poor boys and girls can go to this
school.  That is what I have heard. They say
that they give the boys and girls different kinds
of work to do, so that they can pay their own way
through school.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Booker heard no more. He returned to his work
very greatly excited. That certainly was the place
for him. He then and there made up his mind
that he would go to that school no matter what
happened. He did not know where the place was,
but he determined that he would find it. From
that day on, one thought was in his mind—to go
to Hampton.</p>

<p class='c007'>He wanted to quit work in the mines, because
the work was so dangerous, and because he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>not making enough money. A few days after he
heard the conversation about Hampton, he heard
that Mrs. Ruffner wanted a servant. She was the
wife of General Lewis Ruffner, the owner of the
salt furnaces and the coal mines. The lady, Mrs.
Viola Ruffner, was said to be very strict with her
servants, and consequently no servant would stay
with her long at a time.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Booker heard that she was looking for
another servant, he decided to apply for the
place. He was terribly frightened when he went
into her presence; and he was surprised to find
her very kind and considerate. She employed
him, giving him five dollars a month. She became
very fond of this boy, who worked so hard and
so well and tried to do the work so as to please
her. She showed her interest in his ambition to
get an education, by letting him off a part of the
day to study, and by encouraging him to go to the
night school.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington says also that he learned from Mrs.
Ruffner many valuable lessons in cleanliness,
promptness, and order. He says: “Even to this
day, I never see bits of paper scattered around a
house or in the street that I do not want to pick
them up at once. I never see a filthy yard that I
do not want to clean it, a paling off a fence that I
do not want to put it on, an unpainted or unwhitewashed
house that I do not want to paint or whitewash
it; or a button off one’s clothes, or a grease
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>spot on them or on a floor, that I do not want to
call attention to it.”<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It was while working for Mrs. Ruffner that he
started his first “library.” He got an old drygoods
box, knocked out one side of it, nailed it up
against the wall, arranged some shelves, and then
put into it every book that he could lay his hands
on.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Booker was restless. He wanted to get
started to school. He had not saved much money,
for he had not been working for himself very long,
but he determined to start with what little money
he had.</p>

<p class='c007'>What did his determination mean? Look at
your map and you will see that Hampton is about
five hundred miles from Malden. Booker was a
boy of sixteen years. He did not know a soul
beyond the borders of his own community. He
had but a few dollars. His mother was not well,
and he doubted very much whether he would ever
see her alive again. But he must go and learn, and
his good mother, noble and brave as she was,
encouraged her boy and helped him to get away.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the people in the community were much
interested in his going. While they had never had
a chance, they wanted to encourage this boy who
was so determined to get an education. Some of
them would give him a nickel, some a quarter,
and others a handkerchief to show their desire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>to help him. By and by the day for his departure
came. He put his few dollars in his pocket, picked
up the little satchel containing his few clothes,
said good-by to the neighbors, kissed his weeping
mother good-by, and turned his face towards
Hampton.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no through train in those days, and
he had to travel by stagecoach as well as by train.
He had no idea, when he started, how costly it
was to travel, and he had not gone far before he
realized that he did not have enough money to
take him to Hampton. So he walked much of the
way. He would ask for a ride with passers-by,
and in this way made fairly good progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early in his journey he had a new and trying
experience. He had been riding, together with
a number of white passengers, all day in the
stagecoach. At nightfall they stopped at a house
which was called a hotel, and all the passengers
went in and were given rooms. When Booker
went in and asked for a room, he was told that they
could not take him, that they did not take negroes.
He had not intended to offend. He himself says
it was simply the first time that he realized that
the color of his skin made a difference. He was
so intent upon getting to Hampton, he never
thought of getting angry. He simply walked
about all night, as it was rather cold, and went on
his journey next morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let him tell his own story of another incident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>of this famous journey. “By walking,” he says,
“begging rides both in wagons and in the cars, in
some way, after a number of days, I reached the
city of Richmond, Va., about eighty-two miles
from Hampton. When I reached there, tired,
hungry, and dirty, it was late in the night. I had
never been in a large city, and this was rather to
add to my misery. When I reached Richmond,
I was completely out of money. I had not a single
acquaintance in that place, and being unused to
city ways, I did not know where to go.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I applied at several places for lodging, but
they all wanted money, and that was what I did
not have. Knowing nothing else better to do I
walked the streets. In doing so, I passed by many
places and foodstands where fried chicken and
half-moon apple pies were piled high and made to
present a most tempting appearance. At that
time it seemed to me that I would have promised
all that I expected to possess in the future to have
gotten hold of one of those chicken legs or one of
those pies. But I could not get either of these,
nor anything else to eat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must have walked till after midnight. At
last I became exhausted and I could walk no
longer. I was tired. I was hungry. I was everything
but discouraged. Just about the time when
I reached extreme physical exhaustion, I came
upon a portion of the street where the board sidewalk
was considerably elevated. I waited for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>few minutes, till I was sure that no passer-by
could see me, and then crept under the sidewalk,
and lay for the night upon the ground with my
satchel for a pillow.”<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>When he awoke in the morning, he found that
he was near a large ship which was unloading a
cargo of pig iron. He went directly to the ship,
told the captain his situation, and asked for work
in order that he might earn money with which to
buy some food. The captain gave him work and
was so well pleased with him that he gave him
employment for several days. Washington was
anxious to get enough money to take him to Hampton
as soon as possible. So in order to save as
much of his wages as possible, he continued to
sleep under the sidewalk where he slept the first
night he arrived.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many years after that, he was given a great
reception in Richmond, at a place near this spot,
and Washington says that his mind was more
upon that sidewalk that night than it was upon the
great reception given him by the two thousand
people present.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a few days of work in unloading the vessel,
he felt that he had enough money to take him
to Hampton; so he continued his journey. Several
days later he reached Hampton, with just exactly
fifty cents.</p>

<p class='c007'>What a wonderful journey it had been! And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>now at its end, as the big buildings of the school
came into view, he had a thrill that more than
repaid him for all the hardships of his trip. He
was supremely happy, for he had reached the end
of his rainbow and had found his great treasure.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV<br> <span class='c012'>SCHOOL DAYS AT HAMPTON</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At the close of the Civil War one of the most
important needs of the country was to provide
some kind of education for the negroes. They
had never had any schools. If they were to become
good citizens, they must have the proper
training. A great many good men in the North
and in the South recognized this fact, and set to
work to establish schools. Among these men was
General Samuel C. Armstrong. The General’s
parents had been missionaries to Hawaii. He had
been educated in the United States, had entered
the army as soon as the war began, and had made
such a brilliant record as a soldier that, when the
war was over, he had risen to the rank of general.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had seen a great deal of the negro as a soldier
during the war. He knew about the conditions in
the South, and he felt that the greatest service he
could render would be to give his life to the cause
of education. He went to work at once, and,
through the aid of a number of Southern men, he
established a school for negro boys and girls at
Hampton, Virginia, and called it Hampton Institute.</p>

<p class='c007'>His main purpose was to give negro boys and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>girls an opportunity to learn some useful trade.
He believed that people must first learn to make
a good living before they could make much progress
in any other direction. He wanted the negroes
to have good food and good clothes and good
homes. He wanted them to be able to earn these
things. Likewise, he wanted them to be good
farmers, good carpenters, good brick masons,
good mechanics, and good workmen in all kinds
of trades. He wanted these trades taught in the
schools. Then, as the race progressed, he wished
to have the higher branches of study given, such
as Latin, mathematics, and literature.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Booker T. Washington as a Hampton Graduate</span> (1875)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Thus was begun one of the greatest schools in
America. Every negro boy knows about Hampton.
Thousands of the best negroes in the country
were trained there. General Armstrong was president
of the school and did a wonderful work. He
seemed to inspire
every student who
entered to become
a good and useful
citizen. Too much
cannot be said in
praise of him and
the great school he
founded.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was here that
Booker arrived in
the fall of 1872,
with a little satchel
of clothes, fifty cents
in his pocket, a
happy heart, and
a determination to succeed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as soon as he was able to get an interview, he
went to the head teacher, Mary F. Mackie, and
told her that he wanted to enter school. She
stared at him. He was dirty after his long and
hard journey. His clothes were soiled. He realized
at once that he was making a bad impression, and
it was not his fault. Miss Mackie would not say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>whether she would admit him or not. She made
him wait. He was worried. All he wanted was
a chance to show her that he meant business.
Then a very interesting thing happened. Booker
Washington tells the story himself. He called it
his examination.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After some time had passed,” he says, “the
head teacher said: ‘The adjoining recitation room
needs sweeping. Take the broom and sweep it.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“It occurred to me at once that here was my
chance. Never did I receive an order with more
delight. I knew that I could sweep, for Mrs.
Ruffner had thoroughly taught me how to do that
when I lived with her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I swept the recitation room three times.
Then I got a dusting-cloth and I dusted it four
times. All the woodwork around the walls, every
bench, table, and desk, I went over four times with
my dusting-cloth. Besides, every piece of furniture
had been moved and every closet and corner
in the room had been thoroughly cleaned. I had
the feeling that in a large measure my future depended
upon the impression I made upon the
teacher in the cleaning of that room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When I was through, I rapped on the door,
and reported to the teacher. She was a ‘Yankee’
woman who knew just where to look for dirt.
She went into the room and inspected the floor and
closets; then she took her handkerchief and
rubbed it on the woodwork about the walls, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>over the table and benches. When she was unable
to find one bit of dirt on the floor, or a particle
of dust on any of the furniture, she quietly
remarked, ‘I guess you will do to enter this institution.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was one of the happiest souls on earth. The
sweeping of that room was my college examination,
and never did any youth pass an entrance examination
into Harvard or Yale that gave him
more genuine satisfaction. I have passed several
examinations since then, but I have always felt
that this one was the best one I ever passed.”<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>As a result of his sweeping the room, he was permitted
to enter his classes and was also given a
job as janitor, and his college career began. It
was a new, strange life. He sat down at a table,
which had a cloth on it, to eat his meals. He
slept in a bed that had sheets on it. These sheets
gave him trouble. The first night he slept under
both of them. He didn’t think that was right, so
the next night he slept on top of both of them.
The third night he watched his roommates,—there
were seven of them in the same room,—and
he saw how the thing was done. After that, he
did as the others did and slept between the sheets.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I sometimes feel,” he says, “that almost the
most valuable lesson I got at Hampton Institute
was in the use and value of a bath. I learned there,
for the first time, some of its value was not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>in keeping the body healthy, but in inspiring selfrespect
and promoting virtue. In all my travels
in the South and elsewhere since leaving Hampton
Institute, I have always in some way sought my
daily bath. To get it sometimes when I have been
the guest of my own people in a single-roomed
cabin has not been easy to do except by slipping
away to some stream in the woods. I have always
tried to teach my people that some provision for
bathing should be a part of every house.”<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>For some time he had only one pair of socks.
He had a time of it with these socks. When they
were too soiled to wear, he would wash them out
at night, hang them by the fire and dry them
out, and put them on the next morning. He also
had a hard time with his clothes. They had inspection
every morning. The students were lined
up, and General Armstrong passed along the lines
and carefully examined every one. If a button
was off, or if the clothes were torn or soiled in any
way, the General would see it. Booker had a hard
time keeping his clothes in such a condition that
they would pass muster.</p>

<p class='c007'>His work as janitor was very hard. He often
had to work late at night, for he had many rooms
to clean. He always got up at four o’clock in the
morning to build his fires and do some of his studying.
He had a hard time working and making
expenses too. He usually borrowed his books from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>other students. He soon got some more clothing
from the barrels of clothing sent to the school by
people from the North. Board was ten dollars a
month, part of which he could pay by his work
as janitor, but a part of it he was supposed to pay
in cash, and he had no cash. His work was so
satisfactory, however, that in a short while he was
told that his work would pay all of his board.
S. Griffitts Morgan, of New Bedford, Massachusetts,
paid his tuition. At the end of the year he owed
the college only sixteen dollars.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the college closed at the end of the term,
all the students went home. Booker could not go.
It was too far, and he had no money. He wanted
to get away and get a job, so that he could pay the
sixteen dollars he owed. He had an extra secondhand
coat; so he decided to sell that to get money
to go away on. He cleaned and pressed the coat,
and then let it be known that it was for sale.
After a while a man came to see it. He looked at
it and asked the price. Booker told him three
dollars. The man said, “Well, I think I will take
it. I will tell you what I will do. I will pay you
five cents cash, and the rest as soon as I can get
it.” How do you suppose Booker felt about that?</p>

<p class='c007'>He finally got a job as a waiter in a restaurant
at Fortress Monroe. They did not pay him enough
for him to save anything. One day when he was
cleaning up the place, he found a nice, crisp ten-dollar
bill under a table. He was very happy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Now he could pay back the money he owed at
Hampton. However, he thought he ought to tell
the proprietor about finding the ten dollars. He
did so, and the proprietor coolly took the ten-dollar
bill, saying that, since the place belonged to him,
everything that was found in it naturally belonged
to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>After vacation was over, he returned to Hampton
and was told that he could have as long to pay
the sixteen dollars as he wanted, and that he could
have a job as janitor again. So, his second year
passed much the same as the first. He devoted
much of his time this year and the next to the
debating societies. He says that he never missed
a single meeting while he was at Hampton. He
also organized a new society. He had twenty
minutes every night after supper before work
began. Most of the students, he observed, wasted
this time. He proposed that good use be made of
this period in reading and speaking, and he organized
a society for that purpose. He says that no
time he spent in college was more valuable than
this.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the close of his second year, he went home
to Malden to spend his vacation. His brother John
had sent him some money, and he had earned some
extra money. So he had enough to take him
home. Everybody was delighted to see him, but
most of all, his mother. All the neighbors insisted
on his visiting them and taking a meal with them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>and telling all about his college days. He also
spoke at Sunday schools, at the day school, and
at churches, telling about his life at Hampton.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was all very nice, but he wanted some
work, so that he could earn enough to take him
back to Hampton in the fall. He was unable to
find any work because the salt furnaces and the
coal mines were closed. One day he went further
than usual looking for something to do but without
success. On his way home he became so tired
that he went into a deserted cabin by the road
to spend the night. About three o’clock some one
woke him up. It was his brother John, who told
him that their mother had just died.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was a terrible shock to Booker. He had
had no idea his mother was so ill. He had always
wanted to be with her and care for her. He had
looked forward to the time when he might make
enough money for her to live in comfort. He loved
her very dearly, and her death was the hardest
blow he had ever received.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not long after this that he got some
work and saved enough money to take him back
to Hampton. During his third year at college
he worked harder than ever. He was still working
as janitor, but every single minute he had after
his work was done he spent on his studies. College
boys in those days did not have time to play
football, baseball, and tennis. They did not have
time to go on picnics or have dances.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>The highest honor at Hampton was to be
selected as commencement speaker. This honor
Booker was anxious to win. He worked very hard

honor men of his class as one of the orators. He
was given his diploma, and his college days were
over.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had done a good job. He had done the kind
of work that makes real men. He had trained his
mind and his hands. He had built character.
He was not ashamed. He could hold his head up
and look the world in the face. He had learned
to help himself. He was independent and had
gained self-confidence and self-control. He knew
little of Latin, but he knew much of labor. He
knew no Greek, but he knew how to dig. He knew
the soil. He knew people. He was ready for the
great work that lay before him.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V<br> <span class='c012'>BEGINNING LIFE IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>General Armstrong handed Washington his
diploma in June, 1875, and he walked forth from
the college walls a very proud and happy boy. He
had a right to be. No boy had ever striven harder
for an education. For three years, day and night,
he had worked, as few people ever had. But he
had enjoyed it. Don’t get the idea that Washington
was discouraged or that he was unhappy, for
he was not. He got an immense amount of genuine
satisfaction and pleasure out of his school
days. His teachers were good to him, and he was
devoted to them. His classmates were always
kind to him and helpful and thoughtful. Everybody
was his friend. No boy ever left Hampton
with more warm friends, was more beloved by
students and faculty, than Booker Washington.
And these friendships were truly worth winning,
because they were greater and better than anything
else in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the fine things about Washington was his
independence. He knew how to take care of himself.
He knew he could make his own way in the
world. He was unusually robust, because he had
always taken good care of himself. With health,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>with an education, and with an overwhelming
desire to help his people, he left Hampton and
started his life in the outside world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington left Hampton in exactly the same
financial condition as when he entered. He had
a diploma in his pocket but no money. However,
he was not ashamed of work, if it was honorable,
and he was not afraid of any amount of it. Along
with some other Hampton boys, he was offered
a job in a summer hotel in Connecticut.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he began his new work, he had an embarrassing
experience. The head waiter, somehow,
got the idea that he had done this kind of work
before. He sent him to serve at a table where
several rich people were seated. Washington was
very awkward and confused, and the people
scolded him soundly. It frightened him so that
he went away and would not return to the table,
leaving the guests without anything to eat.</p>

<p class='c007'>For this offense, the head waiter reduced him
from his position as waiter and put him to washing
dishes. Thereupon, he made up his mind that
he would learn to do this job well. So successful
was he that the head waiter soon put him back
at serving, and he made one of the best waiters
in the hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>When his summer’s work was done, Washington
returned to his old home at Malden. Soon after
his arrival, he was chosen to teach the school there.
He accepted the place and began the work at once.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>He taught this school for two years, and it is
doubtful if he ever did better work in his life than
during these two years.</p>

<p class='c007'>All his life the idea had been in Washington’s
mind that he must help his people. This was what
he wanted most to do. This was why he wanted
an education. Many people want an education
for selfish reasons, such as, to make money for
themselves, to have an easy time or to get honors for
themselves, but this was never true of Booker
Washington. His great desire was to help his
people. He looked about him and saw how poor
and helpless and ignorant they were, and his heart
was touched. He wanted to do something that
would make his people better and happier.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now he had his first chance. He went at his
work with great joy. He opened his school at
eight o’clock in the morning, and he usually quit
work about ten o’clock at night. He taught the
children reading, writing, geography and arithmetic,
but he taught them something else too.
He made them comb their hair. He made them
keep their hands and faces clean. He taught them
to keep their clothing clean. He taught them to
use a toothbrush, and to know the value of a bath.</p>

<p class='c007'>He organized a debating society for the men and
boys. He opened a night school so that those who
worked and could not go to school during the day
could go at night. He established a reading room.
He taught several boys privately in order to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>them ready to enter Hampton. He taught in
two Sunday schools. In fact, he did more to make
his community a good, clean, happy community
than anybody had ever done before.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the good things he did was to help his
brother John who had helped him so much while
he was at Hampton and now wanted to go to school
himself. What a joy it was to Booker to be able
to do something for this kind and generous brother!
John did go to Hampton, as did another brother,
James, who was an adopted child; and both
helped Washington loyally in later years at Tuskegee.</p>

<p class='c007'>After teaching two years at Malden, Washington
decided to go to school again. This time he went
to Washington, D. C., and entered Wayland Seminary,
where he remained eight months. He did
not care so much for his work here. It was very
different from the work at Hampton. The students
were all well dressed. They did not have to
work as they did at Hampton. They had plenty
of money, and their studies were different. They
did not have trades, industries, agricultural work,
or dairying, or anything of that kind. They had
Latin and Greek and literature and higher mathematics
and other studies of a similar kind. Washington
felt that he did not get the benefit that he
did at Hampton.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor did he like Washington any better than he
liked this school. He saw too much extravagance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>to suit him. Too many people were trying to get
something for nothing. Too many of them were
trying to get jobs with the Federal Government
that would be easy work and high pay. Many of
the negroes seemed to think it was the business
of the Federal Government to support them.
Washington did not think this was right. He
thought all men should do good, honest work, and
that, if they didn’t, they would sooner or later
find trouble. He was glad to get away, for he felt
that the life that most of the negroes lived at that
time in Washington was most unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of the eight months, he returned to
Malden again. At this time there was a big
campaign on in West Virginia to remove the
capital, which was located at Wheeling. It was
far up in the northern part of the state. Many of
the people wanted another city to be chosen.
The legislature selected three cities to be voted
upon by the people and Charleston was one of
these. Malden, you remember, was five miles
from Charleston. Just after he returned from
Washington, Booker was greatly pleased to receive
an invitation from a committee of white men to
come to Charleston and then go on a speaking
tour in behalf of that city. He accepted the invitation,
and for three months he went about the
state speaking for Charleston as the capital. When
the election was held, Charleston won; and no
small part of the credit was due to the brilliant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>speeches made by the young negro teacher of
Malden.</p>

<p class='c007'>He made such a reputation as a speaker in this
campaign that everybody took it for granted that
he would now study law and enter politics. A
well-known judge tried to persuade him to do
this and offered to teach him law. This was very
flattering, and for a while Washington considered
it. But all the time he had the feeling that there
was something else he must do. He felt that he
could succeed in law and politics, but he also felt
that it would be selfish; that he would be doing
something largely to benefit himself only.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of the negro men in politics, at that time,
were vicious and ignorant. Of course there were
many exceptions; but, as a general thing, the negro
who was in politics during that period was uneducated
and often dishonest. Washington tells
of passing a crowd of men one day as they were at
work on a building. He heard the men saying
to one of the others, “Hurry up, Gov.,” and
“Hurry, Governor.” He paid no attention at
first but finally made inquiry and found that the
negro spoken to had at one time been the lieutenant
governor of the state.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington felt that the greatest thing he could
do was to engage in the kind of work that would
help his own people most. He did not want
to preach. He thought there were too many
preachers already. He had the belief that the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>important thing to do was to engage in the kind
of work that would fit men of his own race to be
good preachers, good teachers, and good citizens.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the midst of these thoughts, and before he
had definitely made up his mind as to his career,
he received a letter from General Armstrong, inviting
him to deliver the “postgraduate” address
at Hampton at commencement, 1879. This honor
brought Washington great joy. He accepted the
invitation and chose as his subject, “The Force
That Wins.” He worked hard for three months
on his speech. It made a great impression on all
who heard it, and he was acclaimed one of the
real orators of his race.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI<br> <span class='c012'>BACK AT HAMPTON</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There is an old saying that “opportunity knocks
but once” upon our door. This is not true. Opportunities
will certainly continue to come to us.
The important thing is to be ready for them when
they come. We never know what incident may
turn out to be our greatest opportunity. If we
will do our best to meet every situation that confronts
us, we may be sure that there will be plenty
of opportunities for us. It is the boy that does
not do his best on all occasions that loses out. So
Washington, when invited to speak at Hampton
commencement, worked hard for three months
preparing that speech. When the time came, he
did his very best. Then he forgot the matter and
went home. Just a few days after he got home, he
had a great surprise. There came a letter to him
from General Armstrong. It said, “We need you
here at Hampton. We want you to come and help
us run the school.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That was a very happy moment in the life of
Washington. He thought more of General Armstrong
than of any other man in the world. To
be asked by this man to come and work for him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>made Washington an exceedingly happy man.
He immediately wrote that he would accept the
position. Some weeks later he reached Hampton,
ready to enter upon his new duties.</p>

<p class='c007'>His job was a rather peculiar one. The Indians
in the United States, who had been put upon
certain territories out West, after being taken from
their land in the South and Southwest, had no
system of education and were entirely without
schools of any kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Armstrong wanted to help them. He
said he believed that they could be educated, and
he wanted to try it. The Government of the
United States gave its consent and agreed to cooperate
with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>They brought from the West to Hampton about
one hundred Indian boys to be educated. These
boys were very ignorant; Booker Washington
says that they were almost wild.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington’s task was to live in the same building
with these Indian boys and look after them—to
be a sort of “house father” to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had a hard job. The Indians are a very
proud people. They felt themselves superior to
the white race, as well as to the black race. They
had a special dislike for the negro because he had
been a slave, and the Indians would not be slaves;
they preferred death to slavery.</p>

<p class='c007'>These boys were not only very ignorant, but
it was very hard to make them understand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>as they did not know the English language
well. Furthermore, everybody expected them to
fail.</p>

<p class='c007'>We usually do just about what people expect of
us. If they think we are going to succeed, it helps
us to succeed. If they think we are going to fail,
it makes attainment of success harder for us.
Booker Washington said: “I will succeed. I will
show these people that these Indians can be
educated.” So for an entire year he worked with
them. He soon won their confidence and respect.
That they all liked him was evident, for they did
everything they could to satisfy him and please
him. He found them ready to work hard and intelligent
enough to be taught. They learned the
different kinds of trades just about as well as the
negroes did. At the end of the year everybody
was willing to admit that Washington had made a
success of teaching the Indians. Ever since then
Indians have been going to Hampton, and many
of them are students there to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington says his hardest task was to get
them to give up some of their old habits and
customs. They did not want to part with their
long hair; they did not want to quit wearing
blankets or quit smoking. However, since these
customs were not customs at Hampton, they all
agreed to do as the others did there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now came another very important work for
Washington. After he had worked with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Indians for a year, General Armstrong said, “I
have another hard job for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Show it to me,” Washington replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>A great many people who did not have any
money were trying to enter Hampton; they were as
poor as Washington was when he entered. General
Armstrong did not want to turn them away.
He finally determined that he would arrange it so
these people could work all day at some trade or
other line of work and thus pay their living expenses
and have something left over to go into
the treasurer’s office to their account. They had
to work ten hours a day to do this. Then they
went to school two hours at night. After a year
or two they would have enough money saved up
from their work to enable them to enter the day
school. This plan proved to be a very fine one,
and many of the best students from Hampton
began in the night school.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was this night school that General Armstrong
wanted Washington to teach. He took charge of
it and made a great success of it. There were
about twelve in the class to begin with. The boys
worked in the sawmill in the daytime, and the
girls in the laundry. They were such good workers
that he named them the “Plucky Class.” After
a boy or a girl had been in this class long enough
to show that he or she meant business and was
going to stick to the job, Washington would give
a certificate that read as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“This is to certify that James Smith is a member
of the Plucky Class of the Hampton Institute and
is in good and regular standing.”<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The students were very proud of these certificates.
It was not long before everybody at Hampton
was talking about the “Plucky Class.” In
a little while there were twenty-five in the group.
The number kept on growing the next year, and
in a few years the class had several hundred members.
It is a big part of Hampton and Tuskegee
to-day, for Washington used the same idea at
Tuskegee.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington had a way of succeeding in everything
he undertook. This was because he determined
to succeed and worked so hard and so well
that success was certain.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII<br> <span class='c012'>BUILDING A GREAT SCHOOL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At Hampton the chapel exercises were at night.
Here they sang the beautiful old negro melodies
and listened to a talk by General Armstrong, or
some other good speaker. One Sunday night in
May, 1881, after the regular exercises, General
Armstrong, who had a way of taking the students
into his confidence as well as keeping them informed
of matters of interest to the race, announced
that he had received a very interesting
letter. He then told them that the Legislature of
Alabama at its last session had set aside some
money for the establishment of a negro normal
school, and that they were looking for a man to
be the head of this school and that he had been
asked to recommend such a man. Of course they
wanted a white man. However, the next day
General Armstrong sent for Booker Washington
and said: “Washington, you heard the announcement
last night about the men in Alabama who
want a man to be the head of their school. I
have decided that you are the man for them.
Will you take the place if it is offered to you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was surely a great surprise, but Booker
Washington was always ready. He said: “I think
I can fill the place, and I am willing to try.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>General Armstrong wrote at once about Washington.
The next Sunday night, during the
chapel exercises, a telegram was handed to General
Armstrong. It was from the committee in Alabama.
He opened it, and read it to the audience.
It said: “Booker Washington will suit us. Send
him at once.”<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Washington prepared to go at once to his new
field. After finishing his work at Hampton, he
paid a visit to his old home at Malden, and a
couple of weeks later, early in June, he arrived at
Tuskegee, Alabama, to begin his new task.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tuskegee at this time was a quiet little town of
about two thousand inhabitants. It is on a small
branch railroad, five miles from the main line,
which runs from Atlanta, Georgia, to Montgomery,
Alabama. The town is about fifty miles from
Montgomery. It is right in the heart of what is
known as the “Black Belt” in the South. A
large and typical population lived round about.
The town was the county seat of Macon County,
in which lived a large number of negro farmers,
all living very much as the negro family lived in
the South at that time. The white people and the
negroes were about equal in population in the
town and lived in cordial and friendly relations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Booker Washington had a great surprise awaiting
him when he reached Tuskegee. He thought
that this school that he was to be the head of was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>already in existence and naturally looked about to
find the schoolhouse, of course expecting to see
a nice building. Imagine his surprise when he
found that there was as yet no school at all
and absolutely no building, no sign of a school
whatsoever. He was to start this school himself
from the very beginning. The legislature had
simply set aside two thousand dollars a year to be
used only for paying salaries, and no provision
had been made for building and grounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Was Booker Washington discouraged? Not for
a single minute did he sit down and whine and
complain and say that he might as well give up.
He went right out into the town, looked up some
of the leading men of both races, and told them
that he was going to start something; that he
was going to open a school. And the men, a little
amazed at first, caught his enthusiasm and said:
“Good for you. We are with you. You can
count on us. We will help.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His first effort was to find a house to use as a
school building, and he finally secured a little
shanty that stood near the A. M. E. Church. It
was agreed that he could use this building for
meetings of any kind, and that he could teach in
the shanty. After consulting again with his
friends, he announced that on July 4, 1881, the
Tuskegee Institute would open.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now that he had a place in which to begin work,
his next job was to get students for his school.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>He began to visit around in the country, making
talks in the churches at the regular service or at
Sunday school and at preaching services in schoolhouses
and other places. He visited in the homes
of the people, and everywhere he told them of
his school plans.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this way he came to know the people just as
they lived, and they learned how sympathetic
Washington was, and how he was trying to help
them. Most of those he visited he found living
in one- or two-room houses, with fat pork and corn
bread as their principal food. But they always
treated him kindly and entertained him the best
they could. One thing that distressed him was
the discovery that many of these people had been
persuaded to buy such things as costly sewing
machines and organs, when they didn’t have
enough to eat and to wear. At one place where
he took dinner there were four in the family, and
when they sat down at the table, he found that
there was but one fork for all five of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their lives were filled with much drudgery and
hard work and almost no opportunities for improvement.
It was nearly impossible for them
to make a living, much less save any money.
Their schools, if they had any at all, had very
short terms and were taught by teachers who knew
very little more than the children. It was a discouraging
situation to any one except a man like
Booker Washington. “These are my people,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>he said. “They need help. They need education
and the kind of education that will give them
cleaner and happier homes, healthier bodies, better
schools, and better life in every way. I am going
to help them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The school opened on July 4, 1881, with thirty
students. Washington was the only teacher.
A large number of students wanted to enter, but
he decided not to admit any under fifteen years
of age. Some of these students were boys, and
some were girls; some were grown men and
women. Most of them had been teachers. None
of them was very well prepared, however, for they
had been very poorly taught. But the teacher
found all of them eager to learn and ready to
work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon there were more students calling for admission.
Within six weeks there were fifty students.
It was necessary to have a new teacher,
and the person secured for this work was Olivia
Davidson, who afterwards became Booker Washington’s
second wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was a great help to him, and she agreed
with him that they must do something for the
students besides merely teaching them books.
Washington says that they wanted to teach them
how to be clean; how to take care of their teeth
and clothing; what and how to eat; and how to
make a living.</p>

<p class='c007'>All these pupils lived on the farm, as did nearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>all the people of the South. Washington wanted
to so teach them that they would continue to live
among their own people and their lives would be
happier and better in every way. He did not want
them to get a false idea about education. Many
of them had the wrong impression already. They
thought that getting an education consisted in
reading big books and then of being able to earn
a living without work. Both of these ideas were
wrong. He wanted to teach them something that
would make them useful and happy and prosperous
on the land in their native state.</p>

<p class='c007'>He certainly could not do this while teaching in
a little old shanty with one room that was in such
bad condition that one of the pupils had to hold
an umbrella over the teacher when it rained.
He had this same experience at his boarding house,
where his landlady often held an umbrella over
him while he ate his breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>About three months after the opening of his
school, a small farm about one mile from town was
offered for sale. Washington went out and looked
it over and came to the conclusion that it was just
the place for the kind of school that he intended
to build. But the price was $500, and he didn’t
have a dollar. The owner said: “Pay me $250
cash, and I will give you one year to pay the
other.” Washington borrowed $250 and closed the
deal.</p>

<p class='c007'>He decided to move the school at once to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>new home. On this farm were four buildings.
The “big house” had been burned, but there was
left standing a little cabin, formerly used as a
dining room, an old kitchen, a stable, and a henhouse.
Booker Washington and his growing school
moved into these four buildings.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image051.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Tuskegee’s First Group of Buildings</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The buildings were thoroughly cleaned and
worked over and put in as good condition as possible.
Washington says, “I recall one morning,
when I told an old colored man who lived near,
and who sometimes helped me, that our school
had grown so large that it would be necessary for
us to use the henhouse for school purposes, and
that I wanted him to help me give it a thorough
cleaning out the next day, he replied, in a most
earnest manner, ‘What do you mean, boss? You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>sholy ain’t going to clean out the henhouse in the
daytime!’”<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Do you know what a “chopping bee” is? Well,
the students of Tuskegee didn’t know until Booker
Washington taught them. After they had been
in their new quarters for several weeks, Washington
walked in one day and said: “To-morrow we
are going to have a ‘chopping bee.’ Now all of
you that have an axe bring it to school with you.
Those of you who do not have one, let me know,
and I’ll get one for you. We will dismiss school
early and go to the ‘bee.’”<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Next day everybody had an axe, and all of them
were wondering what sort of game a “chopping
bee” was. They had never been to one, and they
were much excited over it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after dinner Washington got his axe and
threw it on his shoulder and told the boys to come
on. They eagerly followed. He led them out to
the woods and began cutting down a tree, and
told them to do the same thing. They did so.
Washington, swinging his axe faster and better
than any of them, led the crowd, though all of
them were doing their best. And as they just
kept on at this, it presently dawned on them that
a “chopping bee,” after all, was nothing but plain
cutting down trees and clearing land. Some of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the students became angry. They said they did
not come to school to do that kind of work; they
came to study books. But they looked at Washington,
who was an educated man, and they saw
that he was not ashamed to do this kind of work.
After a time they began to see what Washington’s
purpose was, and they quit complaining and gladly
helped with all their might to get this needful
work done.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was another way in which Washington
secured the assistance of others to build up his
school. He had no way of going about over the
country except by walking. He did not have a
horse or a mule, and he could not cover much
territory by walking. So he would watch for some
old negro with a mule and wagon and go to him
and tell him all about his plans. Then he would
say: “Now, Uncle, don’t you want to help in this
good work? Well, come around early Saturday
morning with your mule and wagon and take me
out in the country, where I can see the people and
tell them about our school,”<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> and the old man
would be there on time.</p>

<p class='c007'>So, with the cordial coöperation of the students
and friends in the town, the school was making
progress. Land was being cleared, and the buildings
and grounds were being improved. Washington
was spreading the fame of his school throughout
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>the country and every one was becoming
interested.</p>

<p class='c007'>But that debt of five hundred dollars for the
land on which the school was being built had not
been paid. Where was the money coming from?
That was the hard question. Miss Davidson
started the plan of having suppers or “festivals.”
She would go about town and get friends to donate
a chicken or a cake or a pie for a supper. In this
way a good sum was raised. Washington wrote
to his friends, explained the situation, and asked
for contributions. He asked the negroes as well as
the white people in town to give, and they did.
Washington says that sometimes they would give
five cents, or twenty-five cents, or a quilt or some
sugar cane. “I recall one old colored woman,”
he says, “who was about seventy years of age,—she
hobbled into the room where I was, leaning
on a cane. She was clad in rags, but they were
clean. She said: ‘Mr. Washington, God knows
I spent de bes’ days of my life in slavery. God
knows I’s ignorant and poor; but I know what
you and Miss Davidson is tryin’ to do. I knows
you is tryin’ to make better men and women for
de colored race. I ain’t got no money, but I wants
you to take dese six eggs, what I’s been savin’ up,
and I wants you to put dese eggs into de eddication
of dose boys and gals.’”<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Washington says
that he has received many gifts for Tuskegee,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>but none that affected him more deeply than
this one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Needless to say, by the end of the year the five
hundred dollars had been raised and the debt paid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus ended the first year of the history of Tuskegee.
If you go there now and see the many fine
buildings, the broad acres, the hundreds of students,
and everything that goes to make up a
great and wonderful college, it would be very hard
to realize that it started off with one little shanty
with a leaky roof, one teacher, and thirty students.
From this simple and humble, but very earnest
beginning, Tuskegee grew by leaps and bounds
until it came to be the most remarkable negro
school in the South.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII<br> <span class='c012'>STRENUOUS DAYS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>As Booker Washington began the second year
of his school, he met a new obstacle. That was
nothing unusual for him, however. He was
usually facing a hard job. He spent his life working
on difficult tasks, and he never found one that
he did not finish with satisfaction. He tackled
this problem at once and with confidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were two parts to it. In the first place,
although he had a fine farm of five hundred acres
all paid for, he had no buildings, except that old
kitchen, stable, and henhouse, in which to house
his students. When school opened in the fall of
1882, there were about one hundred and fifty
students present. These three or four little old
shacks would not take care of that crowd. What
was he to do? This was his first difficulty.</p>

<p class='c007'>His other problem was this. His school was
just outside the town of Tuskegee. It adjoined
the town. A great many people in Tuskegee
thought that this school ought not to be built.
Many were opposed to Booker Washington. Many
were opposed to educating negroes, and they
believed that negroes went to school simply to
get out of work, and that an educated negro was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“sorry” and troublesome. Then there were some
who said: “This man means well, but he is just
a negro, and, of course, he can’t succeed.” Then,
there were others who said: “This man Washington
is all right. I believe in him and trust him.
He is doing a good thing. He is going to succeed.
I am counting on him.” So, his second job was
to win the friendship and good will of all the
people in the town and round about and not to
disappoint those who believed in him. He worked
out these two problems together, as we shall see
from what happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>The very first thing needed by the students
after all was not a building but something to eat.
So the first move Washington made was to start
the students to work on the farm in raising a
crop. Every day, after the students had studied
and recited their lessons, they would go to the
fields and work. We have already learned how
they found out what a “chopping bee” was.
Now they were working in the fields where they
had previously cut down the trees. Some of them
did not like this work at first. They said: “We
did not come to school to do work like this. We
have had enough of this at home.” But Washington
kept right on, working hard himself and showing
his students that he was not ashamed to do
hard work with his hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next thing in order was a building—a
good building, large and comfortable and useful.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>He began to make plans for it. He knew he had
to have it, and, although he really did not have
any money at all in hand, he went right ahead
and planned a fine building to cost six thousand
dollars. He did not know where he would get the
money, but he had a firm belief that in some way
the money would be secured.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image058.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>A Sunday Afternoon Band Concert on the Campus</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When it was learned that he expected to put
up this building, a man who lived near Tuskegee
and who owned a sawmill came to Washington
and said to him: “I have been watching you. I
know what kind of a man you are. You will keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>your word, and you will pay your debts. I see
that you need some help. I just want to say that
I will furnish you all the lumber you need for this
building at once, and you can pay just whenever
you are able.” Washington explained that, while
he hoped to be able to raise the money to pay for
the building, he had not yet secured any of it. The
man replied: “That’s all right. Your credit is
good with me; I will trust you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We can see from this incident how well he was
succeeding in making friends with his neighbors.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as he had raised a part of the money,
he let the man put the material on the ground.
Then the building was begun, and again the students
did all the work. They first digged the
foundations, and some of them became so disgusted
with this work that they left the place
altogether. Washington was sorry that they
left, but he said that any one who was too proud
to work with his hands and help out at a time like
this did not belong in his school. However,
most of the students remained and were perfectly
willing to do the work. Rapid progress was made,
the foundations were finished, and they were
ready for the laying of the corner stone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The laying of the corner stone of this building
is an important event in the history of the education
of the negro. There was a great crowd
present. Washington, his teachers, his students
and their parents, and a large number of other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>negroes were there. There were present, also, a
large number of white people,—the mayor of the
town, the councilmen, the sheriff and all the other
county officers, and all the prominent business
and professional men of the community.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a way this ceremony marks an epoch in
Negro history in America. Just seventeen years
before, it was against the law for a negro to be
taught books at all in Alabama. Just seventeen
years before, the negroes were slaves,—for this
was in 1882 and in the “Black Belt,” in the very
heart of the South. That this large group of white
men should gather with the negroes for the purpose
of dedicating a building to negro education
shows what wonderful change of sentiment had
taken place. It shows also how thoroughly Booker
Washington had won the confidence of all the
people among whom he was working.</p>

<p class='c007'>All his students were from Alabama. Most of
them were from the country. He knew that most
of them would spend their lives on the farm or in
occupations of some kind. He wanted them to be
practical; to know how to do well the things they
would surely be compelled to do. So he determined
from the very beginning that his students should
learn how to do practical things as well as learn
from books. He had them clear the land for the
school; he had them farm the cleared lands; he
had them do the cooking; he had them make the
brick and build the buildings of the school. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>says that his idea was to teach the students the
best methods of labor and how to derive the
greatest benefit from their work. He wanted them
to learn new ways of work,—how to use steam,
water, and electricity. He also wanted to teach
them that work was dignified and honorable and
that no man should be ashamed to do any kind of
honest work.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He followed this plan till his death, and nearly
every one of the many buildings that stood at
Tuskegee when he died was built entirely by the
students themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>They planned to build this first large building—“Porter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Hall” they called it—of brick; so they
went out to make the brick right there. The
students did not like this work. It was hard and
it was dirty. However, they went at it and, after
several trials, found some brick clay.</p>

<p class='c007'>They molded the brick, built the kiln, fired it,
and waited. When the burning was done, they
found that they had made a complete failure.
None of the brick could be used. At once they
built another kiln. This also turned out to be
a failure. Some of them were discouraged at this,
and said: “Let’s quit.” But others said: “We
must succeed.” So a third kiln was built. This
kiln seemed to be burning splendidly when suddenly,
on the last night, it fell.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was surely discouraging, but Washington
was not to be stopped by failure. He was now without
a dollar to continue this work. He happened
to think, however, of a watch he owned. He took
the watch to Montgomery, Alabama, near by,
pawned it for fifteen dollars, came home, called
the workers together once more, built another
kiln, and this time the kiln was a success.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later, when he went back to get his watch, it
was gone; but he never regretted losing it in such
a good cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now that he was successful in making bricks,
the work progressed on the buildings, and soon
Porter Hall was finished, and other buildings were
started.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>There were two other things Washington wanted
for his school. One was a place for his students to
board, and the other, a place for them to room.
Washington said that he had nothing but the
students and their appetites to begin a boarding
department with. However, they got busy, dug
a large amount of earth from beneath Porter Hall,
and opened this basement up for a dining room.
They had no dishes, no knives and forks to speak
of, at first; they had poor arrangements of every
kind. And they had bad luck. Something went
wrong almost every day at first. They would spill
the soup, burn the meat, or leave the salt out of
the bread. Meals were served with no sort of
regularity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington says that one morning he was at
the dining room when everything went wrong.
The breakfast was a failure. One of the girls who
failed to get any breakfast went to the well to get
a drink of water, and found the well rope broken.
Washington heard her say: “You can’t even get
water to drink at this school.”<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> He says that
remark came nearer discouraging him than anything
that ever happened to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He may have been discouraged, but he kept on,
and in a little while things were coming out all
right. And to-day, one of the greatest sights at
Tuskegee is the great dining hall with its white
tablecloths, napkins, and vases of flowers, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>elegant meals served in excellent style and order
and on time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next thing was rooms for the boarders.
Students were coming from a distance. There
was no place for them at the school. Besides,
Washington wanted them at the school so that
he could help them learn best how to keep
their rooms and live as folks ought to live. They
used the cabins first for sleeping quarters, but
they had almost no furniture. They made mattresses
of pine needles. Their bedclothes were
so scant the first winter that several were frostbitten.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon a good house was built, however, for all
the students, and now they began to live as people
ought. Among other things, Washington insisted
that they use toothbrushes. He said that perhaps
no one thing meant more in the real training of the
negro than the proper use of this article. He went
from room to room himself to see whether the students
had them. “We found one room,” he says,
“that contained three girls who had recently arrived
at the school. When I asked them if they had toothbrushes,
one of the girls replied, pointing to a
brush, ‘Yes, sir, that is our brush. We bought it
together yesterday.’ It did not take them long
to learn a different lesson.”<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In many ways, he was able to help these students
learn the proper ways of living—how to sleep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>properly, how to care for their bodies, and how to
take care of their clothes.</p>

<p class='c007'>This second year of the school was truly a
strenuous one in clearing land, raising a crop,
making bricks, building Porter Hall, starting a
boarding department and a rooming department.
Everybody had been busy doing good work, and
everybody was happy. They were making a great
beginning.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>A very important event of this year was the
marriage of Washington to Fannie M. Smith.
They had known each other back in Malden,
and, as soon as Washington’s work was well begun,
they were married. She lived only two years after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>her marriage, dying in 1884, and leaving a daughter,
Portia M. Washington. Several years later
Washington married Olivia Davidson, the teacher
who had been associated with him in the school
almost from the first, and who had done so much
to help him in getting the school started.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX<br> <span class='c012'>RAISING MONEY FOR TUSKEGEE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Tuskegee grew rapidly and steadily. Students
began to pour in from all parts of the country.
Girls were coming as well as boys. It was absolutely
necessary to find some place for these students
to live and carry on their school work.
Tuskegee Institute had no money. You will remember
that the Legislature of Alabama appropriated
two thousand dollars a year for the payment
of teachers, but gave nothing for buildings or
land or equipment. So if new buildings were to be
erected, it meant that the money would have to
be raised by some other means. This was not a
church school, and it could not, therefore, appeal
to any religious denomination for help. There
was only one way to secure funds for its development
and growth and that was by going out and
asking people directly for aid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington did not like to do this, but, recognizing
the necessity for it, he went bravely ahead.
And perhaps no man was ever more successful in
this work than he was. President Charles W.
Eliot, of Harvard University, had to raise money
in the same way for Harvard. He was so successful
that it was said of him, “When he goes to rich
men they just throw up their hands and say,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>‘Don’t shoot! How much do you want?’” And
President Eliot said that Washington could beat
him raising money.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before Washington’s death in 1915, it required
from $250,000 to $300,000 a year to run Tuskegee.
That is a big sum of money. A very large part
of it had to be raised by personal solicitation.
And it had to be raised almost entirely in the
North. This meant that Washington had to
spend a large part of his time away from Tuskegee,
traveling over the country, making speeches, and
talking to individual men. It was hard work,
and it took a great deal of strength and effort
as well as time. He had many remarkable experiences.
He met many great and good people, who
were glad to help him. He had an opportunity
to tell them about his school and about his people
in the South; and an opportunity to hear this remarkable
man was given to many people.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the way he was led to undertake this
work. When the girls began coming to school,
they had to have a dormitory. The boys had
been staying in the attic of Porter Hall, living
in the shanty, or boarding in town. But this would
not do for the girls. They must have different
accommodations. The boys ought to have, but
the girls <em>must</em> have better surroundings. So they
proceeded to plan a dormitory. They did not have
any money with which to build a house. It was
just like starting Porter Hall. But they said they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>could at least plan the kind of building they would
build if they had the money. They made plans
for a building that would cost ten thousand dollars,
and named it Alabama Hall. But that Alabama
Hall was on paper only and in the minds of
folks; so they could not use it very well.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Then an interesting thing happened. Have
you noticed how often something interesting
turned up with Washington? Perhaps there is a
good reason for it. “Nothing ever comes to one,
that is worth having, except as a result of hard
work,” Washington himself has said. It was not
just an accident after all that these good things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>were happening. It was because Washington by
his work and his good sense had made lasting
impressions upon people who were in positions to
give him help.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is what happened. While thinking about
how he could get the ten thousand dollars for
Alabama Hall, he received a letter from General
Armstrong, asking if he would agree to go with
him on a tour of the North; if so, to come to
Hampton at once. Washington was delighted
and accepted the invitation. To his great surprise
he found that General Armstrong had planned to
take a quartette of singers from Hampton and go
himself with Washington on a tour of the North
in the interests of Tuskegee. Washington thought
the trip was planned for Hampton, of course,
and, when he found that General Armstrong had
been so unselfish as to plan it for him, he was overcome
with gratitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had a great trip. General Armstrong had
Washington do most of the speaking. “Give them
an idea for every word,” he said to Washington
as they started. And Washington did. It was
on this trip that Washington first introduced
Tuskegee to the people of the North, and that the
people first got acquainted with Washington.
When he returned from this trip, he was able to
begin work on Alabama Hall, and it was soon
completed and paid for. From this time on
Washington went North a great deal to speak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>publicly and to talk privately to men about the
needs of Tuskegee.</p>

<p class='c007'>He met a great many rich men. He had many
interesting experiences with them. He did not
“beg” from them. He says he always followed
two simple rules in this work: first, to do his full
duty in presenting the needs of the school, and,
second, not to worry about the results. He found
these rich men unlike what he had expected. He
said they were among the best and kindest and
most generous people in the world. While he sometimes
received discourteous treatment, as a rule
he was gladly received and treated with great
respect, and help was gladly given.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three of the rich men who helped Washington
a great deal were: Collis P. Huntington, the great
railroad builder; H. H. Rogers, of the Standard
Oil Company; and Andrew Carnegie, the philanthropist,
who had made a fortune in the steel industry.
Washington says that the first time he
interviewed Mr. Huntington he received a donation
of two dollars. Two dollars from a multi-millionaire!
But the last donation he received
from Mr. Huntington was a check for fifty thousand
dollars. And between the two gifts there had
been gifts of many thousands. Mr. Rogers also
gave many thousands of dollars and helped particularly
in the great extension work of the college.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee Institute</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The most liberal giver was Andrew Carnegie.
As soon as Carnegie heard of the work that Washington
was doing, he sent for him to come to New
York City. The result was that Carnegie gave him
fifteen thousand dollars with which to build a
library. Washington and his coworkers spent a
great deal of time working out the plans for this
building. All the work was done by the students
of Tuskegee. When it was completed, Carnegie
was amazed that such a beautiful and useful building
had been built for that sum of money. It
convinced him that these people could be trusted
to spend money wisely. He therefore determined
to give a large sum to the school. Thus it happened,
in 1903, that the President of the Board of
Trustees of Tuskegee received the following letter:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>I have instructed Mr. Franks, Secretary, to deliver
to you as Trustee of Tuskegee $600,000 of 5 per
cent U. S. Steel Co. bonds to complete the Endowment
Fund as per circular.</p>

<p class='c016'>One condition only—the revenue of one hundred
and fifty thousand of these bonds is to be
subject to Booker Washington’s order to be used by
him first for his wants, and those of his family during
his life or the life of his widow. If any surplus is
left he can use it for Tuskegee. I wish that great
and good man to be free from pecuniary cares that
he may devote himself wholly to his great mission.</p>

<p class='c016'>To me he seems one of the foremost of living
men, because his work is unique,—the Modern
Moses, who leads his race and lifts it through
Education to ever better and higher things than a
land overflowing with milk and honey. History
is to know two Washingtons,—one white, the other
black, both fathers of their people. I am satisfied
that the serious race question of the South is to be
solved wisely only by following Booker Washington’s
policy, which he seems to have been especially
born—a slave among slaves—to establish, and,
even in his own day, greatly to advance.</p>

<p class='c016'>So glad to be able to assist this good work in
which you and others are engaged.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>One other name must be mentioned, and that is
Julius Rosenwald of Chicago. Mr. Rosenwald
not only gave large sums himself—and is still
giving enormous amounts not only to Tuskegee
but to the cause of negro education throughout
the South—but frequently left his own business
and helped to raise money among his friends for
Tuskegee.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There were many large gifts from many men
and women, all of whom cannot be mentioned here
of course, but most of the money that was given
to Tuskegee came in small amounts from a large
number of people,—from churches, Sunday
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>schools, missionary societies, and other organizations;
from preachers, teachers, lawyers, doctors,
farmers—from every class of people came gifts,
sometimes large and sometimes small. All the
graduates of Tuskegee were loyal and gave something,
however small the amount might be. The
Alabama Legislature gave more and more as the
school grew. The Slater Fund and the Peabody
Fund also began to make annual contributions to
the school.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was through all these channels that the money
came pouring into Tuskegee in such amounts that
it was possible for it to grow and develop in a
remarkable way. Building after building went
up. New students came. New equipment was
purchased. Additional faculty members were
secured. And the school grew in size and usefulness
and in favor in the eyes of the people.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X<br> <span class='c012'>MAKING SPEECHES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Frederick Douglass and Booker Washington
rank as the greatest orators the negro race has
ever produced. This is a high place to occupy,
for the race has produced many remarkable
speakers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Douglass was the great spokesman for the race
just before the Civil War and during the troublesome
days of reconstruction. Washington began
his career just at the time that Douglass ended
his. Douglass was a very eloquent man; perhaps
more eloquent at times than Washington. On the
other hand, Washington was a better educated
man than Douglass and probably had a more
lasting influence upon his generation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Booker Washington made thousands of speeches
in his life. He spoke to white and black; in the
North and in the South; in Europe as well as in
America. He spoke in churches; at school commencements;
at conventions; at educational and
religious meetings; at county fairs; and to every
kind and condition of people. He spoke before
kings and presidents; he spoke to the lowliest
men of his own race in the heart of the black belt
in Alabama. It is a wonderful thing to be an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>orator; to speak to men and women in such a way
that they will be helped and inspired and made
happier and more useful.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Washington was at Hampton, he began
to learn the art of speaking. You remember how
he organized a debating society which met for the
twenty minutes they had between supper and time
to begin work. You remember how he spoke and
spoke at these meetings, doing his best to learn
how to express himself well. One of his teachers,
Miss Mackie, knew of his ambition to become a
good speaker, and she gave him a great deal of
help, teaching him how to stand, how to pronounce
his words, and how to control his voice and gestures.
By much hard work he came to be the best
speaker among the boys at Hampton.</p>

<p class='c007'>You will recall, too, how General Armstrong
invited him to deliver the alumni address in 1879,
and what a big success he made of that. All this
time he was speaking at Sunday schools, at
churches, at educational meetings, and everywhere
he had an opportunity. His trip North with
General Armstrong gave him much valuable
experience.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first speech that he made that attracted
the attention of all the people was at the National
Education Association, in Madison, Wis. The
most important thing he said in this speech was
that the “whole future of the negro rested largely
upon the question as to whether or not he should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>make himself, through his skill, intelligence, and
character, of such undeniable value to the community
in which he lived that the community
could not dispense with his presence.” He said
that any one who “learned to do something better
than anybody else—learned to do a common
thing in an uncommon manner—had solved his
problem, regardless of the color of his skin.”<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> He
also said that the two races ought to be brought
closer together and cultivate the most cordial
and friendly relations, rather than become bitter
toward each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the greatest speech of Washington’s life
was the Atlanta speech. In the year 1895 the
people of Georgia determined to hold a great
Cotton States Exposition, in Atlanta, which would
set forth the progress of the South since the Civil
War. In order to make the exposition a great
success it was necessary to have the financial
assistance of Congress. So a committee was appointed
to go to Washington to confer with a
committee from Congress. Booker Washington
was appointed on this Georgia committee; and
his speech in Washington before the Congressional
committee was one of unusual force. Many said
it was the best speech made. Congress gave the
assistance asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the authorities came to plan the exposition
in detail, they decided to have a Negro
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Division. The negroes were asked to take part,
and they gladly agreed to do so. They built one
of the best buildings on the grounds. This building
was planned by a negro architect and was erected
entirely by negro labor. It contained exhibits
prepared altogether by negroes. It was one of the
most interesting parts of the entire exposition.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the exposition was formally opened in
September, 1895, Booker Washington was invited
to make an address as a representative of the
negro race. James Creelman, a noted newspaper
man, the correspondent of the New York <cite>World</cite>,
heard that speech, and he wrote to the <cite>World</cite> about
it. This is what he wrote:</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mrs. Thompson, one of the other speakers on the program,
had hardly taken her seat, when all eyes were turned
on a tall, tawny negro, sitting in the front row of the platform.
It was Professor Booker T. Washington, President
of the Tuskegee (Alabama) Normal and Industrial Institute,
who must rank from this time forth as the foremost man of
his race in America. Gilmore’s Band played the ‘Star-spangled
Banner,’ and the audience cheered. The tune
changed to ‘Dixie’ and the audience roared with shrill
‘hi-yi’s.’ Again the music changed, this time to ‘Yankee
Doodle,’ and the clamor lessened.</p>

<p class='c016'>“All this time the eyes of the thousands present looked
straight at the negro orator. A strange thing was to happen.
A black man was to speak for his people, with none to interrupt
him. As Professor Washington strode to the edge
of the stage, the low, descending sun shot fiery rays through
the windows into his face. A great shout greeted him. He
turned his head to avoid the blinding light, and moved about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the platform for relief. Then he turned his wonderful
countenance to the sun without a blink of the eyelids, and
began to talk.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There was a remarkable figure; tall, bony, straight as
a Sioux chief, high forehead, straight nose, heavy jaws, and
strong, determined mouth, with big white teeth, piercing
eyes, and a commanding manner. The sinews stood out
on his bronzed neck, and his muscular right arm swung high
in the air, with a lead pencil grasped in the clinched brown
fist. His big feet were planted squarely, with the heels
together and the toes turned out. His voice rang out clear
and true, and he paused impressively as he made each point.
Within ten minutes the multitude was in an uproar of enthusiasm—handkerchiefs
were waved, canes were flourished,
hats were tossed in the air. The fairest women of Georgia
stood up and cheered. It was as if the orator had bewitched
them.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And when he held his dusky hand high above his head,
with the fingers stretched wide apart, and said to the white
people of the South, on behalf of his race, ‘In all things that
are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers, yet one
as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress,’ the
great wave of sound dashed itself against the walls, and
the whole audience was on its feet in a delirium of applause.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I have heard the great orators of many countries, but
not even Gladstone himself could have pleaded a cause with
more consummate power than did this angular negro, standing
in a nimbus of sunshine, surrounded by the men who
once fought to keep his race in bondage. The roar might
swell ever so high, but the expression of his earnest face never
changed.</p>

<p class='c016'>“A ragged, ebony giant, squatted on the floor in one of
the aisles, watched the orator with burning eyes and tremulous
face until the supreme burst of applause came, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>the tears ran down his face. Most of the negroes in the
audience were crying, perhaps without knowing just why.</p>

<p class='c016'>“At the close of the speech Governor Bulloch rushed
across the stage and seized the orator’s hand. Another
shout greeted this demonstration, and for a few minutes
the two men stood facing each other, hand in hand.”<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It was a wonderful speech. It contained much
good advice both to the whites and to the negroes.
It was fair to both. As Clark Howell, editor of
the <cite>Atlanta Constitution</cite>, said, “It was a platform
upon which both races, black and white, could
stand with full justice to each other.”<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> In the
speech he told the following story: “A ship lost
at sea for many days suddenly sighted a friendly
vessel. From the mast of the unfortunate vessel
was seen a signal: ‘Water, water; we die of thirst.’
The answer from the friendly vessel at once
came back, ‘Cast down your buckets where you
are.’ A second time the signal, ‘Water, water,
send us water,’ ran up from the distressed vessel,
and was answered, ‘Cast down your buckets where
you are.’ And a third and a fourth signal for water
was answered, ‘Cast down your buckets where
you are.’ The captain of the distressed vessel,
at last heeding the injunction, cast down his
bucket, and it came up full of fresh, sparkling
water from the mouth of the Amazon River.”
Washington then appealed to his own people to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“cast down their buckets where they were,” by
making friends with their white neighbors in every
manly way, by training themselves where they
were in agriculture, in mechanics, in commerce,
instead of trying to better their condition by immigration.
And, finally, to the white Southern
people, he appealed to “cast down their buckets
where they were,” by using and training the
negroes whom they knew rather than seeking to
import laborers whom they did not know.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Frederick Douglass had died only a few months
before this great speech was made. At once from
all parts of the country came the statement, “Here
is the man who will take the place of Douglass
as leader of the negro race.” And from that time
on, Booker Washington was the accepted leader
of his people in this country.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was immediately called upon to speak in all
parts of the country. He was offered big sums of
money to lecture. One speaker’s bureau offered
him fifty thousand dollars a year. He refused all
these offers of money, saying that he must give
his time to Tuskegee and to the interests of his
people, rather than try to make money for himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another of his great speeches was made at
Cambridge, Mass., in 1896. Harvard University,
the oldest and most famous university in America,
conferred the honorary degree of master of arts
upon Mr. Washington in 1896. This was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>first time in the history of America that a college
or university of such high standing had ever conferred
an honorary degree upon a negro. Washington
says this honor was the greatest surprise of
his life. At the time the ceremony of conferring
this degree took place, he made a speech that won
great applause from the audience.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is very interesting to read Washington’s own
account of his experiences. “People often ask
me,” he says, “if I feel nervous before speaking,
or else suggest that, since I speak so often,  they
suppose I get used to it. In answer to this question
I have to say that I always suffer intensely from
nervousness before speaking. More than once,
just before I was to make an important address,
this nervous strain has been so great that I have
resolved never again to speak in public. I not
only feel nervous before speaking, but after I have
finished I usually feel a sense of regret, because it
seems to me as if I had left out of my address the
best thing that I had meant to say.... Nothing
tends to throw me off my balance so quickly, when
I am speaking, as to have some one leave the room.
To prevent this, I make up my mind, as a rule,
that I will try to make my address so interesting,
will try to state so many interesting  facts one after
another, that no one will leave.”<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Washington made it a rule never to say anything
to a Northern audience that he would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>say to a Southern audience. He also made it a
rule never to say to a negro audience anything
that he would not say to a white audience. In
this honest and fair way he kept close to the
truth, and at the same time never offended fair-minded
people of either race.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a capital story-teller, but he did not
make a practice of telling jokes and funny stories
in his speeches, just to make people laugh. He
always had a serious purpose in his stories. He
had two or three stories that he told frequently,
because they were so full of meaning. This was
one of them: One day he was going along the
road, and he met old Aunt Caroline, with a basket
on her head. He said, “Good morning, Aunt
Caroline. Where are you going this morning?”
And she replied, “Lor’ bless yer, Mister Washington,
I dun bin where I’s er goin.” “And so,” he
would then say, “some of the races of the earth
have done been where they was er goin’. But the
negro race is not one of them. Its future lies
before it.”<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Another of his stories was about a good old
negro who accompanied Washington on one of his
tours. At a certain city they found that they had
several hours before the train left; so this old man
decided to stroll about to see the town. Presently,
he looked at his watch and found that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>it was just about time for his train to leave, and
he was some distance from the station. He rushed
to a hack stand, and called out to the first driver
he came to, who happened to be a white man,
“Hurry up, and take me to the station; I’s gotta
get the 4:32 train.” To which the white driver
replied, “I ain’t never drove a nigger in my hack
yit, an’ I ain’t goin’ ter begin now. You can git
a nigger driver ter take ye down.”<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>To this the old colored man replied with perfect
good nature, “All right, my friend, we won’t
have no misunderstanding or trouble; I’ll tell
you how we will settle it; you jest hop in on der
back seat an’ do der ridin’ an’ I’ll set in front an’
do der drivin’.” In this way they reached the
station on good terms, and the old man caught his
train. Like this old negro, Washington always
devoted his energies to catching the train, and it
made little difference to him whether he sat on
the front or back seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two other speeches of Washington attracted
wide attention. One of these was delivered in
Boston in 1897, at the time of the dedication of a
monument to Robert Gould Shaw. Shaw was the
Colonel of the famous negro regiment of soldiers
from Massachusetts in the Civil War. It was in
this regiment that Sergeant William H. Carney
served,—the man who triumphantly carried the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>flag in the great battle of Fort Wagner, and exclaimed
after the fight, “The old flag never touched
the ground!” Colonel Shaw lost his life in the battle
of Fort Wagner, while leading his negro regiment.
The people of Boston erected a monument
to his memory, and Washington’s speech at its dedication
was one of the greatest he ever made.</p>

<p class='c007'>One other speech was delivered in Chicago in
1898 at a great Peace Celebration, following the
close of the Spanish-American War. There was
an enormous crowd—the largest he ever spoke
to, Washington says. There were sixteen thousand
people present. President McKinley was there,
together with several cabinet members and other
distinguished guests. “The President was sitting
in a box at the right of the stage,” says Washington.
“When I addressed him I turned to the box,
and as I finished the sentence thanking him for
his generosity, the whole audience rose and cheered
again and again, waving hats and handkerchiefs
and canes, until the President arose in the box,
and bowed his acknowledgments. At that the
enthusiasm broke out again, and the demonstration
was almost indescribable.”<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The demands for him to speak were so great
that it was impossible for him to meet them
all. He often spoke three and four times a day.
He was away from Tuskegee, making speeches, a
large part of his time. He made extended tours,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>by special train, all over the states of Virginia,
North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. On these
tours he spoke to thousands and thousands of
people. Everywhere he went all the people, white
and black, heard him gladly. The good that this
man did through his oratory cannot be overestimated.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI<br> <span class='c012'>SUCCESS AS EDUCATIONAL LEADER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Booker Washington spent his life in the education
of the negro. Negroes of ability in his day
usually became preachers or they entered politics.
The negro preacher had rendered a greater service
to his people, perhaps, than any one else. Before
1865, the ministry was practically the only place
where negro leadership could find expression. It
was much the same way for many years after the
Civil War. However, after emancipation, there
was an opportunity for leadership in politics, and
a great many negroes of ability entered this field,
many of them holding offices.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington was urged by some of his friends
to enter the ministry. Others urged him to study
law and enter politics. Undoubtedly he could
have made a great success in either of these fields
of work. But from the very beginning of his
education, he had a strong conviction that his life
must be spent in helping to educate his people.</p>

<p class='c007'>He felt that education was the greatest need of
his race. Before the war, it had been against the
law for a slave to be taught from books. At the
close of the war, then, there were no schools, no
teachers, and no books. The whole race could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>neither read nor write. The whole race had had
no training of any kind except in agriculture. It
is true a few, but a very few, had had a little training
in certain trades such as bricklaying, blacksmithing,
and carpentry. The race, therefore,
through no fault of its own, was very ignorant. It
had never had an opportunity.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image089.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Chemistry Class, Tuskegee Academic Department</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But now that the opportunity had come with
emancipation, the entire race was eager to learn.
Old men and old women, as well as boys and girls,
began with great zeal to learn to read and write.
The race started to school. It was determined to
get an education, and it was to help in this great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>work that Washington early determined to devote
his life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just after the war there was much confusion
and doubt about the best plan to follow in educating
the negro. The Freedmen’s Bureau brought
a large number of teachers from the North to
assist in the task, and much valuable work was
done in the negro schools by these teachers. The
different Southern states also began to make provision
for the negro’s education, by organizing
schools, building schoolhouses, and making provision
for training teachers.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was much difference of opinion as to just
what should be taught the negro. As a rule, the
plan followed was to teach him just what had been
taught in the white schools. This meant that he
would study reading, writing, arithmetic and
grammar, and later, Latin, Greek, mathematics
and literature.</p>

<p class='c007'>So much of this kind of teaching was done, and
it was so poorly done, and it was so poorly adapted
to the needs of the negro at the time, that a great
many people began to doubt the wisdom of trying
to educate the negro at all. But Washington insisted
that the mistake was made in the kind of
education they were trying to give him. In answer
to the question, “Does it pay to educate the
negro?” Washington often told the story of what
had taken place in Macon County, Alabama,
the county in which Tuskegee is located. In that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>county, he and Mr. H. H. Rogers decided to build,
with the coöperation of the people themselves, a
system of excellent schools, and try out as
thoroughly as possible the question of the effect
of education upon the negro, under favorable conditions.
They put up good schoolhouses, secured
good teachers, taught practical subjects, and ran
the schools for eight or nine months in the year.</p>

<p class='c007'>What was the result? In a short time people
began to come from all parts of the state and outside
the state to buy land or to work within reach
of these excellent schools. Land advanced in
price. Desirable citizens flocked in. Homes were
improved. Good roads were built. Better farms
appeared. Crime diminished. The sheriff said
that he practically had no further use for the jail.
Cordial relations existed between the white and
negro people. In every way Macon County came
to be a better place to live in. The race problem
was solved in that county. People were happy
and prosperous. They were living clean, wholesome,
contented lives. The whole problem of
living was, in a large measure, solved. And it was
all due to education of the people, and education
of the right kind. What was good for Macon
County, Alabama, would be good for every county
in the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington’s ideas of education were very
simple. He had studied carefully the needs of his
people. What he wanted was a system of education
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>that would help people directly and immediately;
that would enable them to make better
crops; build better homes; wear better clothes;
eat better food; live cleaner and purer and happier
lives. He wanted his people to learn to live;
and he believed the school was the place to learn
that lesson.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/image092.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Truck Gardening, Tuskegee Institute</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He wanted the children to study practical things;
the things they needed. He thought, therefore,
that the school ought to be very closely related
to life. His idea was that that school was best
which turned out students who could earn their
own living at once; who had the ability to take
care of themselves in whatever environment they
happened to be; and who had genuine character.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“My experience has taught me,” he says, “that
the surest way to success in education, and in any
other line for that matter, is to stick close to the
common and familiar things—things that concern
the greater part of the people the greater part
of the time.”<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It was this belief in the close relation between
school and life that caused him to have his students,
at the beginning of the building of Tuskegee,
cut down the trees, plant the crops, make the
bricks, build the buildings, cook the food, care
for the dormitories, look after the live stock, and
do everything that was to be done about the place.
He wanted his students to learn to do well all
these tasks that they would face in later life. And
he also wanted them to learn that it was a perfectly
honorable and dignified and sensible thing
to labor, to work, to do anything that was honest
and useful.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps there is no better way of understanding
Washington’s ideas of education and just what he
was striving to do at Tuskegee than to describe
the commencement exercises at this school.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the platform before the audience is a miniature
engine to which steam has been piped, a
miniature frame house in course of construction,
and a piece of brick wall in process of erection.
A young man in jumpers comes on the platform,
starts the engine and blows the whistle. Whereupon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>young men and women come hurrying from
all directions, and each turns to his or her appointed
task. A young carpenter completes the
little house, a young mason finishes the laying of
the brick wall, a young farmer leads forth a cow
and milks her in full view of the audience, a sturdy
blacksmith shoes a horse, and, after this patient,
educative animal has been shod, he is turned over
to a representative of the veterinary division to
have his teeth filed. At the same time, on the
opposite side of the platform one of the girl students
is having a dress fitted by one of her classmates,
who is a dressmaker. She at length walks
proudly from the platform in her completed new
gown, while the young dressmaker looks anxiously
after to make sure that it ‘hangs right behind.’
Other girls are doing washing and ironing with
the drudgery removed in accordance with advanced
Tuskegee methods. Still others are hard
at work on hats, mats, and dresses, while boys from
the tailoring department sit cross-legged working
on suits and uniforms. In the background are
arranged the finest specimens which scientific
agriculture has produced on the farm and mechanical
skill has turned out in the shop. The
pumpkin, potatoes, corn, cotton, and other agricultural
products predominate, because agriculture
is the chief industry at Tuskegee, just as it is among
the negro people of the South.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“This form of commencement exercise is one of
Booker Washington’s contributions to education
which has been widely copied by schools for whites
as well as blacks. That it appeals to his own people
is eloquently attested by the people themselves,
who come in ever-greater numbers as the commencement
days recur. At three o’clock in the
morning of this great day, vehicles of every description,
each loaded to capacity with men,
women, and children, begin to roll in, in an unbroken
line which sometimes extends along the
road for three miles. Some of the teachers at
times objected to turning a large area of the Institute
grounds into a hitching-post station for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the horses and mules of this great multitude, but
to all such objections Mr. Washington replied,
‘This place belongs to the people and not to us.’
Less than a third of these eight or nine thousand
people are able to crowd into the chapel to see
the actual graduation exercises; but all can see
the graduation procession as it marches through
the grounds to the chapel, and all are shown
through the shops and over the farm and through
the special agricultural exhibits, and even through
the offices, including that of the principal. It is
significant of the respect in which people hold the
Institute, and in which they held Booker Washington,
that in all these years there has never
been on these occasions a single instance of drunkenness
or disorderly conduct.”<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“One of our students in his commencement
oration last May gave a description of how he
planted and raised an acre of cabbages. Piled
high upon the platform by his side were some of the
largest and finest cabbages I have ever seen. He
told how and where he had obtained the seed;
he described his method of preparing and enriching
the soil, of working the land, and harvesting
the crop; and he summed up by giving the cost
of the whole operation. In the course of his account
of this comparatively simple operation, this
student had made use of much that he had learned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>in composition, grammar, mathematics, chemistry,
and agriculture. He had not merely woven into
his narrative all these various elements that I
have referred to, but he had given the audience
(which was made up largely of colored farmers
from the surrounding country) some useful and
practical information in regard to a subject which
they understood and were interested in. I wish
that any one who does not believe it possible to
make a subject like cabbages interesting in a
commencement oration could have heard the
hearty cheers which greeted the speaker when, at
the close of his speech, he held up one of the largest
cabbages on the platform for the audience to look
at and admire. As a matter of fact there is just as
much that is interesting, strange, mysterious and
wonderful; just as much to be learned that is
edifying, broadening, and refining in a cabbage
as there is in a page of Latin. There is, however,
this distinction; it will make very little difference
to the world whether one negro boy, more or less,
learns to construe a page of Latin. On the other
hand, as soon as one negro boy has been taught to
apply thought and study and ideas to the growing
of cabbages, he has started a process which, if it
goes on and continues, will eventually transform
the whole face of things as they exist in the South
to-day.”<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It can be readily seen from these two accounts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>just what kind of education Washington believed
in and tried to give his students at Tuskegee.
It was quite different from most of the training
that had been given the negro after the war. In
those early days of freedom, many of the negroes
seemed to have the idea that the bigger the book
and the harder the words in it, the better the
education was that they secured. Some of them
thought, too, that they were not educated unless
they studied Latin and Greek and higher mathematics,
and other similar subjects. Booker Washington
did not mean that history, literature, and
foreign languages should not be studied and had
no value. What he was emphasizing was the fact
that boys and girls should first get a clear idea of
things about them. Then they would be able
better to understand and appreciate such subjects
as history and literature.</p>

<p class='c007'>One other feature of the kind of education that
Tuskegee stands for ought to be mentioned, and
that is the extension work. This work has become
a very large part of the Institute. The extension
work is not so much a matter of teaching, of
education in the usual sense, as it is an effort to
give direct and practical help to people outside
the college walls. Most of this extension work
has been done in Macon and adjoining counties.
From the first month of his school, Washington
began to go into the country round about and
mingle with his people. He went to their homes,
their churches, their schools. He saw their poor
farms, their lean stock, their dilapidated houses,
their lack of the comforts and necessities of good
living. The homes, the churches, the schoolhouses
were in bad condition. Washington had the
greatest sympathy for these people, knowing
why they were in poverty and ignorance, and
he had a great desire to help them. And it is
through this extension work that these people are
helped.</p>

<p>The students’ band of this rural school is instructed by a band student of Tuskegee Institute.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>The Institute sends its workers throughout the
surrounding country to show the farmers improved
farm machinery, better methods of farming,
better breeds of live stock of all kinds, better
methods of dairying, and better ways of preparing
food, keeping house, and caring for the children.
They insist on improving the school buildings,
the churches, and the homes. As a result of this
work, there are now in Macon County a number
of neat new schoolhouses, with a teacher’s house
alongside each school, several acres of land adjoining,
and a good church close by. Thus clean,
pleasant, and thoroughly happy communities are
created. In such communities there is the smallest
amount of crime, and there is the largest amount
of prosperity and contentment and enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the graduates of Tuskegee are enthusiasts
for education and community builders. Wherever
they go, they stand for the best in life. They
are devoted to Tuskegee and its spirit and its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>ideals. It is this devotion which makes them industrious
and capable and law-abiding and helpful
in every possible way in the communities in which
they live. Hundreds of small schools have been
established all over the South by these graduates,
patterned on Tuskegee. It is impossible to overestimate
the good they have done.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tuskegee has grown to be one of the greatest
schools in the country, and the greatest of all
schools for the negroes. It has grown from 100
acres and three little buildings to a plant of 2100
acres and 111 buildings. Instead of one teacher
with 30 pupils there are now more than 200 teachers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>and 1500 students. The institution has a large
endowment, and it owns 20,000 acres of land given
it by the United States Government. It keeps a
large dairy herd, runs a large farm, a poultry farm,
and keeps a large number of pigs, horses and sheep.
Every phase of education is taught, but the main
work is industrial,—carpentry, brick masonry,
basket making, metal working, draughting, auto-mechanics,
blacksmithing, telegraphy, farming,
dairying, lumbering, building, cooking, sewing,
nursing, housekeeping—all these and a large
number of other callings are taught. It is through
such training as this that Washington believed
that the negroes, in largest numbers, would first
get their best start in life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Life is strenuous in this school. Here is an outline

<p class='c007'>Washington has done more for the education
of the negro than any other one man, white or
black. His work at Tuskegee, his great educational
campaigns, and his speeches and writings
have combined to make his accomplishments of
supreme value. Not only has he done this for
the negro, but his work has helped the cause of
education for the white people very greatly. All
education in the South was backward. Like his
great teacher, General Armstrong, Washington
realized that in their progress the two races
were bound together in the South, and that they
must grow or step backward together. It is impossible
for the negro to make his best progress
unless the white man does so at the same time.
And of course this works both ways. Because he
believed this, Washington was anxious for school
conditions for white people to change just as well
as the school conditions for negroes. Besides,
he wanted all the people to have the advantages
of education. He did not hate anybody, and consequently
did not want anybody to be deprived
of the best there was in life. He did not want
anybody, white or black, to fail to have his best
opportunity. So he worked for the advancement of
the cause of the white schools as well as the black,
and his services to the white schools were great.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>The future of negro education is very bright.
Schools and colleges are being built every year.
Better teachers are being prepared. Children are
going to school in larger numbers than ever before,
and their work is more satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every year the states appropriate more and
more money for negro education. The negro is
now able to pay a large part of the cost of his own
education, and he is very willingly doing so.</p>

<p class='c007'>The negro is determined to get an education.
When he gets it, he will be a better citizen. And
the better the citizens of a country are, the better
life is in every way, and the more completely are
all our problems solved.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII<br> <span class='c012'>LEADING HIS PEOPLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Immediately following Washington’s great
speech in Atlanta in 1895, there came the statement
from all parts of the country, “Here is the
new leader of the negro race.” During the last
years of slavery, and the Civil War, and on for
years after the war, Frederick Douglass, as has
been said, was the acknowledged leader of the
negro in the United States. Douglass had died in
the early part of the year 1895. It seemed that
this man Washington had been raised up to take
his place. The Atlanta speech continued to be a
topic of discussion throughout the country, and
coupled with this discussion was invariably the
statement that here was the new leader of the
race.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington says that he was at a great loss to
know what people meant when they referred to
him as the leader of his people. Of course, this
leadership was not a thing that he had sought.
The people thrust this duty upon him, and of
course no man has a right to shun or dodge responsibility
that is thus bestowed.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was not in doubt long as to what it meant
to be a leader. One of the first things that happened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>was the large number of invitations that
came to him to deliver addresses. These requests
came from all parts of the country and from all
sorts of organizations. A very large number of
these invitations he was compelled to refuse.
However, when he felt he could serve his institution
and his people, he always accepted.
He represented the Negro at the unveiling of the
monument of R. G. Shaw, in Boston; and at the
Peace Convention in Chicago in 1898, at which
time President McKinley spoke. He attended
most of the large religious gatherings of his people
throughout the country, and spoke before them.
Almost immediately there began to pour in on him
a perfect flood of letters from all parts of the country,
from white and black, high and low, rich and
poor, asking a thousand different questions. Now
it would be a letter from a railroad president
asking about some problem of dealing with his
employees; now from a school man asking about
the segregation of the races in schools. Again,
from a legislator, asking advice on some legislation;
but principally the letters came from his own
people, asking all sorts of questions about a
multitude of things. One man wanted Washington
to use his influence to secure the adoption of
a flag for the negro race; another wanted his
backing for a patent medicine that would take the
curl out of the negro’s hair. Another wanted to
know if the negro race was dying out; another,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>if the race was being blended with the white race;
another, if he thought the negro was being treated
right politically. Perhaps the most remarkable
request, however, was from a woman, who wanted
him to find her husband who had deserted her
some years before. And in order that he might
be easily identified she describes him: “This is the
hith of him 5–6 light eyes dark hair unwave shave
and a Suprano Voice his age 58 his name Steve.”<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>To all of these letters he replied in the fullest
and frankest and kindest way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whenever there was race friction in the South,
he was invariably called upon either to go in
person or to send a message. For example, when
the Atlanta riots occurred in 1906, Washington
was in the North. He took the first train South.
He went among his own people in Atlanta first,
and then he went to the white people—to the
Governor, the Mayor, the leading citizens, ministers
and merchants. Largely through his wise
counsel and efforts order was restored, and plans
were made for the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a spokesman for his people he wrote constantly
for the press. Such papers as the <cite>Montgomery
Advertiser</cite>, the <cite>Atlanta Constitution</cite>, the
<cite>New Orleans Picayune</cite>, the Louisville <cite>Courier
Journal</cite>, the Chicago <cite>Inter-Ocean</cite>, and the Boston
and New York papers gladly published his articles.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>He also contributed frequent articles to the
weekly journals, such as <cite>The Outlook</cite>, and to the
monthly magazines, such as <cite>The Century Magazine</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>He carried this phase of his leadership even
further than the current press, in that he made
some notable contributions to the historical literature
of his race. The first book he wrote was
“Up from Slavery.” This is one of the greatest
pieces of literature published in America. The
Hon. Walter H. Page, late Ambassador to Great
Britain, said: “The only books that I have read
a second time or ever cared to read in the whole
list (of literature relating to the negro) are ‘Uncle
Remus,’ and ‘Up from Slavery,’ for these are the
great literature of the subject.”<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Believing the accomplishments of the race
should be better known to his own people, Washington
determined to write a history of the Negro.
“The Story of the Negro—the Rise of the Race
from Slavery” was the title of the book he wrote,
setting forth the wonderful progress of his people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other books by him were, “My Larger Education,”
“Learning with the Hands,”—about eleven
titles in all. These books are of high literary merit,
and in no other way, perhaps, did Washington so
definitely place himself as a leader of his people as
in the realm of authorship. These books, in addition
to their literary value, were of great benefit
to the white race as well as to his own race, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>getting before all the people a proper estimate of
the real accomplishments of the negro.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most important phases of his leadership
of the negro was in the organization of the
<em>National Negro Business League</em>. It was one of
Washington’s strongest beliefs that the negro
must prove himself able to exist and prosper in
business matters. The race—individually and
collectively—must demonstrate its ability to
take care of itself in all phases of industrial life.
Another of his important principles was that the
negro should emphasize his opportunities rather
than his drawbacks. As he went about the country,
he noted the wonderful progress made by the
negro in all lines of business. He felt that it would
be a great inspiration to those who had achieved
success or leadership to know each other, and a
still greater encouragement to all the people if
they knew the real progress being made. Acting
upon these ideas, he called a meeting of representatives
of a large number of businesses to be
held in Boston, in August, 1900. Here was organized
the <em>National Negro Business League</em>. Washington
was made president and continued to hold
this office until his death in 1915.</p>

<p class='c007'>The organization brought together from year to
year all the representative negro business men of
the country. They made reports of their progress
and planned for future advancement. The league
has been a wonderful factor in the development of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>the business life of the negro. Several other
organizations, such as the Negro Press Association,
the Negro Bar Association, the Negro Funeral
Directors’ Association, and others have grown
out of this league. It was through this league, as
perhaps through no other agency, that the negro
learned of his own great wealth, of his success in
banking, in manufacturing, in merchandise, in
the undertaking business, and in a large number
of other industries. It gave him a wonderful pride
in the accomplishments of his race. He knew
that the negro was proving to the world that he
possessed all the elements necessary for handling
any phase of his economic life. He could take care
of himself in the business world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington did a great deal for the negro farmer.
It has already been pointed out how he served the
people of his county, and how the extension work
of the Institute was used to help the farmer. In
addition to this he organized the Tuskegee Negro
Conference. In the beginning, this was a sort of
agricultural experience meeting on a large scale.
The good farmers from all the surrounding country
were brought in, and each was asked to relate his
successful experience. Every phase of farm life
was covered. Every person present was profited
by the experience and the success of his neighbor.
This conference has greatly broadened in scope
and has grown to be of large proportions and great
influence.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Washington was truly the Moses of his people,
as Andrew Carnegie had said. He led them with
great wisdom in their thought and their conduct.
He was their spokesman, their interpreter. He
guided them to higher and better things. He made
the white man and the negro know each other
better and understand each other better. He
lessened the friction between the races and increased
the good will. He brought encouragement
and inspiration to his own race and gained the
sympathy and coöperation of the white race.
Everywhere he opposed ignorance and prejudice
and injustice in any form. Because of his wisdom
and tact as a leader, not only the negro but the
entire nation was helped.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII<br> <span class='c012'>POLITICAL EXPERIENCES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Most of the negroes who gained any prominence
or influence in the years just after the Civil
War entered politics. Bruce and Revels had been
United States Senators; Elliott and Smalls and a
dozen others had been Congressmen; Pinchback,
Lynch, Langston, Gibbs, and Greener had been
sent for diplomatic service to foreign countries,
and others had held high State offices; and a
multitude of negroes had been county and city
officials of various kinds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Everybody expected Washington to accept some
kind of political position, but he steadfastly refused.
Time after time, men of his own race and
white men urged him to run for office, or accept
an appointment by the President to high office.
This he absolutely refused to do. He said that his
service, whatever it was worth, would be given,
not in politics but in education. He believed that
entirely too much emphasis had been placed on
holding office by the negro, just after the war.
He was more concerned about whether or not his
people could have the opportunity to earn an
honest living than he was about getting some
political job.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>He was often misunderstood about his ideas on
holding office and the whole question of the part
the negro should take in politics; for he was convinced
that there were other things far more important
at that time to the negro than the matter
of voting.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was one phase of politics, however, that
Washington did keep in close touch with. This
can be best explained by giving some of his correspondence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Theodore Roosevelt, immediately after taking
the oath of office as President of the United States,
in Buffalo, after the death of President McKinley,
wrote Mr. Washington the following note:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'><span class='sc'>Buffalo, N. Y.</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Dear Mr. Washington:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>I write you at once to say that to my deep regret
my visit South must now be given up.</p>

<p class='c016'>When are you coming North? I must see you
as soon as possible. I want to talk over the question
of possible appointments in the South exactly
on the lines of our last conversation together.</p>

<p class='c016'>I hope my visit to Tuskegee is merely deferred
for a short season.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>Faithfully yours,</div>
      <div class='line'>(Signed) Theodore Roosevelt.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Booker T. Washington, Esq.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Tuskegee, Ala.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“In response to the above note Mr. Washington
went to the White House and discussed with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>President ‘possible future appointments in the
South.’”<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately following this conference with the
President, there was a vacant judgeship in Alabama
which gave the President an opportunity
to carry out his ideas about Southern appointments.
He called upon Washington for advice,
and Washington, being unable to go himself at the
time, sent his secretary, Emmett J. Scott, to
Washington as his representative. Largely upon
the recommendation of Washington, Judge George
Jones, a Democrat, was appointed to this position.
This was an event of great significance indeed,
when a Republican President of the United States
appointed a Southern Democrat to office. It was
done in accordance with the ideas of both the
President and Washington,—that only men of the
highest fitness, regardless of color or party, should
receive appointment.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this time on, Washington was one of the
President’s chief advisers in Southern appointments.</p>

<p class='c007'>President Roosevelt, of course, appointed many
negroes also. He believed that, when negroes
possessed the proper qualifications for offices, they
should have a share in them. Washington did
not try to get very many negroes appointed, but
he did try to get the very best negro when one was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>appointed. In other words, he was trying to improve
the quality rather than increase the quantity
of negro officeholders. After one of Washington’s
speeches, in which he laid special emphasis on this
idea, President Roosevelt sent him the following
letter:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>My dear Washington:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>That is excellent; and you have put epigrammatically
just what I am doing—that is, though
I have rather reduced the quantity, I have done my
best to raise the quality of Negro appointments.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>With high regards,</div>
      <div class='line in16'>Sincerely yours,</div>
      <div class='line in12'>Theodore Roosevelt.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Throughout the administrations of President
Roosevelt and President Taft, Washington was
constantly called into conference and rendered a
lasting service to his own race and to the people
of the country in giving wise counsel, not only
about politics but about a great many things pertaining
to the welfare of his people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington was often criticized very severely
by members of his own race for his position with
reference to voting. His ideas on this question
are well stated in the following quotation:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am often asked to express myself more
freely than I do upon the political condition and
the political future of my race.... My own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>belief is, although I have never before said so in
so many words, that the time will come when the
negro in the South will be accorded all the political
rights which his ability, character, and material
possessions entitle him to. I think, though, that
the opportunity to freely exercise such political
rights will not come in any large degree through
outside or artificial forcing, but will be accorded
to the negro by the Southern white people themselves,
and that they will protect him in the
exercise of these rights. Just as soon as the South
gets over the feeling that it is being forced by
‘foreigners’ or ‘aliens’ to do something which it
does not want to do, I believe that the change in
the direction that I have indicated is going to
begin.”<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Again he says: “I contend that, in relation to
his vote, the negro should more and more consider
the interests of the community in which he lives,
rather than seek alone to please some one who
lives a thousand miles from him and his interests.”<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>While he believed, theoretically, in universal,
free suffrage, he very frankly admitted that the
peculiar conditions existing in the South made it
necessary to put restrictions upon the ballot. He
was opposed, however, to any discriminations in
the law; and he urged with all his power that the
negro be given good educational and business
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>advantages, so that he might fit himself for the
full responsibilities and duties of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington himself never had any trouble
about voting. He always registered and always
voted, and no one ever raised an objection to his
doing so.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV<br> <span class='c012'>VISITS TO EUROPE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Washington was a great traveler. He was
away from his home at least half of each year and
often more than that. He traveled principally in
the North, making speeches and interviewing
people who might help Tuskegee. While on these
trips, he did most of his reading and writing. He
was very fond of newspapers and magazines.
When he started on a long journey, he surrounded
himself with a large number of papers and magazines
and books, which he thoroughly enjoyed.
History was his favorite field of reading outside
of newspapers and magazines. He was especially
fond of biography—of reading about real men,
men of action and thought and great talents.
Much of his greatest inspiration as a boy came
from reading the lives of great men. Lincoln was
his greatest hero. He said that he had read practically
every recorded word of Lincoln’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington also did much of his writing on
these trips. He kept his stenographer with him
all the time, and, when he was not reading, he was
usually dictating a speech, or a letter, or an article
for a magazine. A large part of his greatest book,
“Up from Slavery,” was written while he was on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>the train or waiting at stations between trains. It
is remarkable that he should have been able to
accomplish so much under such circumstances, for
traveling was hard work. He often had to get up
in the middle of the night to catch a train and then
ride all day, often
without Pullman accommodations.
He
said that he had
slept in three different
beds in one
night, so broken
was his rest and so
often did he have
to change trains
in order to keep
engagements. Undoubtedly
it was
this hard traveling
that helped to break
down his great
strength and wear
him out.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Booker T. Washington, First Principal of Tuskegee Institute</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In 1899 he made a speech in Boston, and some
of his friends noticed that he seemed extremely
tired. He remained in Boston several days.
One day during his stay a friend asked him if he
had ever been to Europe. He replied that he had
not. He was asked very casually whether he
thought that he would enjoy a trip to Europe.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>He said that he certainly would, but he did not
ever expect to have such a pleasure. A day or
two later some of his friends came to him and told
him they had a little surprise for him, that they
had made arrangements for him and his wife to
go to Europe in the summer and spend several
months on a vacation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington was very greatly surprised. He
thanked his friends very cordially for their interest
but told them that he could not afford to
take the trip. Whereupon they told him that all
the money for the expenses of the trip had already
been raised, and that it would not cost him a cent.
He thanked them again very sincerely but told
them he could not think of leaving his work that
long,—that money had to be raised for Tuskegee,
and that he had to stay right on the job to
get it. Then they told him that a group of his
friends had already raised enough money to keep
Tuskegee going until he got back. He then gave
another excuse. He was afraid people would say
that he was “stuck up”; that since he had made
some success in the world he was trying to show
off and play the big man. His friends told him that
sensible people would not think such a thing,
and that he need not bother about the people who
had no sense. Washington thought, too, that he
had no right to quit work so long. He had worked
all his life. There was a world of work yet he had
to do. To go off on a vacation of several months,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>when there was so much to be done, and when
other people were at work, seemed wrong to him.
But he realized finally that a reasonable amount
of rest, when one is tired, means more and better
work in the long run.</p>

<p class='c007'>So it came about that, on May 10, 1899, Washington
and his wife went aboard the ship <em>Friesland</em>
in New York harbor and sailed for Europe. It
was a wonderful experience for Washington. In
the first place, as he went aboard the ship, he received
a message from two of his friends telling
him that they had decided to give him the money
to build a magnificent new building at Tuskegee.
That was a good “send-off.” Washington was
a bit uneasy about how people would treat him
aboard ship. He knew what unfortunate experiences
some members of his race had had in times
past. But the captain received him cordially,
and everybody on board was exceedingly courteous
to him and to his wife in every way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington on his way to Europe! It seemed
to him like a dream. Again and again he had
thought of Europe,—much as he did of heaven,—a
goodly place, but far away. It had never even
occurred to him that he would ever go to Europe.
And now he was on his way! He was like a schoolboy;
he was happy over the prospect of a wonderful
trip.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not get seasick on the voyage, as most
of the passengers did. The weather was fine, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>he had a glorious voyage. But he did not know
how tired and worn out he was until he relaxed.
About the second day he began to sleep, and he
says that from then on until they landed he
slept at least fifteen hours every day. He continued
the habit of long hours devoted to sleep
all the time he was gone, and it was one of
the means by which he restored his depleted
strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a fine voyage of ten days, they landed at
Antwerp, a famous old city of Belgium. Here they
spent a few quiet days, finding it extremely interesting
to observe the people with their dress
and manners and customs, different from anything
they had ever seen before.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then they went on a delightful journey through
the picturesque country of Holland. Washington,
always interested in farming and especially dairy
farming, was greatly delighted on this trip. On
every hand were the wonderful farms of the
Dutch. He had never seen such intensive cultivation
of land. Every foot of ground was used.
Vegetables were grown in boxes, one row above
another, on the back porches of the houses, so
precious was the scarce land. Ten or twelve acres
was a good big farm. Coming from a country
where land is so abundant and cheap and so extravagantly
wasted and so carelessly cultivated,
these beautiful farms were a delight to him. And
the herds of fine Holstein cattle pleased him immensely.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>He loved cows; and these seemed to be
the finest herds he had ever seen in his life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Out of Holland and back into the historic and
now heroic Belgium, the party went, going to
Waterloo, the famous battlefield of Napoleon’s
defeat, and to other places of interest; and from
here to Paris, the gayest and brightest of all the
cities of Europe, the capital of France.</p>

<p class='c007'>While in Paris, Washington met a number of
distinguished Americans. He made two or three
important speeches and was given a reception by
the American ambassador at Paris. He met ex-President
Harrison, General Horace Porter, our
ambassador, Justices Fuller and Harlan, of the
United States Supreme Court, and other distinguished
men, all of whom were most cordial
and friendly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The American whom he found most interesting
in Paris, however, was a negro—Henry O. Tanner.
Tanner is an artist, a painter. He is the
son of the beloved Bishop Tanner and was born in
America. He showed marked talent for painting
in his youth. When he grew up, he determined
to go to the greatest city in the world for art. He
went to Paris and became so successful in his
work that he has continued to live there. He has
several paintings in the Louvre, the greatest and
most exclusive art gallery in the world. A picture
cannot be put in the Louvre unless it is recognized
and accepted as a great work of art. Washington
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>spent much time with Tanner and was greatly
pleased to see what marked success had been won
by this American negro. He took it as proof of
his contention that, when a negro proves himself
really worthy, he will be recognized and honored,
for Tanner enjoyed the esteem and regard of all
his associates, regardless of race. And they esteemed
him because of his worth, and not because
of his color.</p>

<p class='c007'>From Paris the Washingtons went to London.
Here they visited many places of historic interest,—the
British Museum, Westminster Abbey, St.
Paul’s, and the House of Commons. They met
many interesting people,—the Duke and Duchess
of Sutherland, Joseph H. Choate, American ambassador
to England, Henry M. Stanley, the
great African explorer, with whom Washington
conversed at length. They were also received by
Queen Victoria, at Windsor Castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had been a wonderful trip. Washington had
learned many lessons from the Old World. He
had seen and talked with men who helped him in
the better understanding of his own great task.
He had had a wonderfully good time. He was
thoroughly rested—a new man. He plunged
into his work again upon his return with great
vigor and enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington made two other trips to Europe
during his lifetime. The second one was largely
like the first—a trip for recreation and pleasure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>and rest. But the third trip was undertaken with
a serious purpose. He wanted to see how the
poor people of Europe lived, and how their living
conditions compared with those of the workingman
in the United States. He was particularly
anxious to see how conditions there compared
with those affecting the negro population of the
South. He also wanted to see whether or not he
could find anything in Europe that would justify
the system of education he had established at
Tuskegee. So this time he left the usual highways
of travel and went far into the interior, visiting
the peasant in his hut, in the remotest regions of
the country,—the miner toiling underground, the
laborer in the quarry, and the poor man at his
work whatever it was and wherever he could be
found. He visited the farms in the remote parts
of Poland, Austria, and Italy. He went to the
sulphur mines in Campo Franco. At Catania he
saw the grape harvest and the men barelegged,
treading the wine press as they did in Bible times.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a very remote part of Poland, away up in
the mountains, he stopped at a little thatched-roof
cottage. Desiring to see how the place looked
on the inside, he knocked at the door. In response
a man opened the door, and Washington said
something to him in English, thinking, of course,
that the man would not understand, but that he
would be able to see inside the hut. To his utter
astonishment, the man answered him in English.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Upon further conversation, he found that this man
had once lived in Detroit, Michigan.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he was in the mines at Campo Franco,
Sicily, he by chance met a man who had once
worked in the mines near Malden, West Virginia,
where Washington himself had worked when a
boy. The world is not such a big place after all!</p>

<p class='c007'>As a result of his observations of conditions in
Europe, Washington came to the conclusion that
the negro in the South is, generally speaking, in
far better condition than the peasant of Europe.
He also noted that, wherever conditions were
fairly good, where the natives owned the land and
had developed reasonably good farming conditions,
there was no emigration from that region
to America. But where conditions were bad,
where farms were not well kept, where the people
were not permitted or encouraged to own their
own homes, from such sections there was always
much emigration to America. In other words,
good local conditions, land ownership, good schools,
and so on, tended to make the people happy, contented,
and desirous of remaining where they
were. In this fact he saw a great lesson for his
own people. He believed that the South is the
home of the negro, that here it is possible for him
to do his best. He was, therefore, tremendously
anxious for the negroes to learn how to cultivate
the soil to the best possible advantage, to buy
land, to build schools, to establish churches, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>in every way to become real citizens of the country
where they were.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington wrote an interesting book describing
all that he saw and learned on this trip. It is
called, “The Man Farthest Down.” As stated
before, he pointed out that there were many, many
people “farther down” than the American negro;
that compared to most of the people of Europe,
he ought to be exceedingly thankful that his condition
is as good as it is. Of course he did not
mean by this that conditions with the negro were
what they ought to be; but that the negro should
be thankful for the progress that he has made;
that he should take courage, and go forward to
better things.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most interesting experience of this trip to
Europe was his visit to the King and Queen of
Denmark, at Copenhagen. On his first visit to
the palace he was received by the King. Washington
was much impressed by the King’s cordiality
and simplicity, by his knowledge of America,
and by his acquaintance even with the work
Washington was doing at Tuskegee. At the close
of the interview, the King invited him to dine at
the palace that night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the invitation of a king is the same as a
command, and one is always expected to accept.
Of course Washington was delighted to accept this
invitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington spent the rest of the day preceding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>the dinner hour visiting the country people near
Copenhagen. He was late getting home, and he
was terrified when he realized that he might be
late for dinner. To keep the King and Queen waiting
would be a terrible offense. He dressed as
rapidly as he could. But in his haste, he pulled his
necktie to pieces,—the only one he had fit for
the occasion! He pinned it together the best he
could and put it on; but he says that he was in
great distress throughout the dinner lest the tie
come to pieces again.</p>

<p class='c007'>He reached the palace just in time for the
dinner. He was taken directly to the King, who
led him to where the Queen was standing, and
presented him to her. She was very cordial and
gracious. She spoke English perfectly; and Washington
was again surprised to find that she, too,
was thoroughly familiar with affairs in the United
States, and that she also knew about Tuskegee.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a very distinguished group of people
present. The dinner was given in the magnificent
Summer Palace, and everything was truly royal
in its elegance and splendor. Washington says,
“As I ate food for the first time in my life out of
gold dishes, I could not but recall the time when
as a slave boy I ate my syrup from a tin plate.”<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV<br> <span class='c012'>BOOKER T. WASHINGTON: THE MAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Booker Washington at home, with his wife
and children, his garden, his chickens, his pigs,
his horses and cows, is far more interesting than
Washington the orator, the writer, the teacher,
the traveler, the college principal.</p>

<p class='c007'>No man ever loved his home more than Washington.
He had to be away from it much of the time.
He was away at least half of each year. This was
a great hardship to him, and just as often as was
possible he got away from his exacting duties and
returned to Tuskegee to find rest and quiet and
comfort and joy with his own family.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was an early riser, when at home, getting
up always at 6 o’clock. His first morning task
was to gather the fresh eggs. He was very fond
of chickens and always kept a number of them.
“I begin my day,” he says, “by seeing how many
eggs I can find, or how many little chicks there
are that are just beginning to creep through the
shells.... I like to find the new eggs myself, and
I am selfish enough to permit no one else to do
this....”<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>He was very fond of animals of all kinds, but
the pig was his favorite. He always kept a number
of the very finest breeds of Berkshires and
Poland Chinas. After gathering the fresh eggs, his
next job was feeding the pigs. After that came
a visit to the cows. He always kept a good garden,
too, and a part of the early morning was given
to working in it. He had a very peculiar custom
or idea about his garden work. He always worked
barefooted. He said that there was something
in the soil that gave one strength and health and
power,—but you had to get it by direct contact
with the soil.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this early morning round of work was
done, he mounted his horse for an hour’s ride.
He usually rode over the college farm and thoroughly
inspected it; then to the dairy, and all
over the college grounds, to see that everything
was going as it should.</p>

<p class='c007'>After breakfast, he went to his office and gave
his attention to the day’s mail, which averaged
daily about 125 incoming and 800 outgoing letters.
Later in the day he would visit classrooms, inspect
the building that was going on, go to the
great dining hall at dinner, go to the shops, talk
to the students and to the members of the faculty
as he met them. Just before supper he would call
for his horse again and go off for an hour’s ride or
for a hunt. Sometimes he would walk rather than
ride. While on these walks, he would often run
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>for a couple of miles at top speed. After supper,
there was usually a meeting of some kind,—a
committee or faculty meeting, or conference with
a delegation of visitors. Chapel exercises, devotional
in character, came at 8:30. And after
that, very frequently, there was an inspection of
the dormitories.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had three children, Portia, Booker, and
Davidson. One of his greatest pleasures was to
take the children for a long walk on Sunday afternoons.
They would tramp for miles through the
fields and woods, gathering flowers or nuts or
berries. They studied the trees, the flowers, and
the birds. They waded in the streams, ran footraces,
and played games.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every night after supper he would romp and
play with the children. He would roll on the floor,
let the children ride on his back, play all sorts of
jolly games, or he would tell stories. He was an
excellent story-teller, and it was always a treat
to hear the wonderful tales he could tell.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington was married three times. His first
wife, as stated in a previous chapter, was Fannie
M. Smith, of Malden, who died in 1884, leaving
a daughter, Portia. The second marriage
was to Olivia Davidson, who had been a teacher
at Tuskegee from its beginning. She had been of
wonderful assistance to Washington in the early
days of Tuskegee. She was the mother of the
two boys, Booker, Jr., and Davidson. His third
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>marriage was to Margaret Murray, of Mississippi,
a graduate of Fisk University and for several
years a teacher at Tuskegee. This marriage occurred
in 1892. Mrs. Washington has had a very
useful and distinguished career. No woman of
her race has helped her people so much in recent
years. She will be remembered not merely as the
wife of Booker Washington, but for her own remarkable
service to her people.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Booker T. Washington and His Family</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Washington was a man of unusual personal appearance.
From the description that James Creelman
gave of him on the occasion of his famous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>speech in Atlanta, it can readily be seen that he
was a man of commanding and striking personality.
Wherever he went he attracted attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was an untiring worker. He went at tremendous
speed all the time. He could do as much,
as a rule, as three or four ordinary men. He kept
a stenographer with him all the time. As he went
about the grounds he would dictate suggestions
and ideas for changes and improvements. He
would often awaken his stenographer at night to
dictate a letter or a speech or a statement for the
papers. In this way he never overlooked an
important thought or idea that occurred to him,
and his ideas were always taken down while fresh
and vivid in his mind. He often confounded his
faculty by his tremendous energy. He would call
them in and lay out enough work for them to keep
busy for a week and, then, almost before they
could get started, demand results. He could
work so fast himself and do so much, he never
realized that it took other people longer to finish
a task.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had a very active mind. He could think
quickly. He was also a good judge of men and
knew the worth of a man almost at sight. When
any subject was presented to him, he would arrive
at conclusions quickly and accurately.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he grew older, he exhibited a certain amount
of absentmindedness, due, perhaps, to concentration
of mind. He would meet his best friends on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>the street and not speak to them. He was so preoccupied
by his thinking that he simply did not
recognize folks when he met them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington was a proud and independent man.
Many people thought he was conceited. He was
far too great a man for that. He was not vain
and he was not ashamed of himself or his race.
He held his head high. He could not be cowed.
He had great self-confidence. He knew his abilities
and powers and thought it his duty to appraise
them properly. This he did in a very intelligent
and sensible way. But he was not boastful; in
fact, he was very humble. Many of the things
which he said and did that were often taken for
personal vanity and boastfulness were not personal
at all but were evidences of his pride in his race.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington had great sympathy for the unfortunate.
He was constantly bringing up in
faculty meeting the case of some poor negro who
was in distress,—who couldn’t pay the rent, was
without food or clothes, or was in hard luck in
some way. He insisted that these people be helped
regardless of how they came to be in their unfortunate
condition. Scarcely a day passed that
he did not give aid to some one who needed it.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was an old, crack-brained preacher who
would come to the Institute and speak by the hour
right outside the office, but Washington would
not let him be disturbed and always gave him a
little contribution.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>There was another old negro who had great
ability in getting contributions from Washington.
“One day, when Washington was driving down
the main street of Tuskegee behind a pair of fast
and spirited horses, this old man rushed out into
the street and stopped him as though he had a
matter of the greatest urgency to impart to him.
When Mr. Washington had with difficulty reined
his horses and asked him what he wanted, the old
man said breathlessly, ‘I’se got a tirkey for yo’
Thanksgivin’!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘How much does it weigh?’ inquired Mr.
Washington.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Twelve to fifteen poun’.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“After thanking the old man warmly, Mr.
Washington started to drive on, when the old
fellow added, ‘I jest wants to borrow a dollar for
to fatten yo’ tirkey for you!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“With a laugh, Mr. Washington handed the
old man a dollar, and drove on. He never could
be made to feel that by these spontaneous generosities
he was encouraging thriftlessness and mendicancy.
He was incorrigible in his unscientific
open-handedness with the poor, begging older
members of his race.”<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“Old man Harry Varner was the night watchman
of the school in its early days, and a man
upon whom Mr. Washington very much depended.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>He lived in a cabin opposite the school grounds.
After hearing many talks about the importance
of living in a real house instead of a one- or two-room
cabin, old Uncle Harry finally decided that
he must have a real house. Accordingly he came
to his employer, told him his feeling in the matter,
and laid before him his meagre savings, which he
had determined to spend for a real house. Mr.
Washington went with him to select the lot and
added enough out of his own pocket to the scant
savings to enable the old man to buy a cow and a
pig and a garden plot as well as the house. From
then on, for weeks, he and old Uncle Harry would
have long and mysterious conferences over the
planning of that little four-room cottage. It is
doubtful if Mr. Washington ever devoted more
time or thought to planning any of the great
buildings of the Institute. No potentate was ever
half as proud of his palace as Uncle Harry of his
four-room cottage, when it was finally finished and
painted and stood forth in all its glory to be admired
of all men. And Booker Washington was
scarcely less proud than Uncle Harry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“With Uncle Harry Varner, ‘Old man’ Brannum,
the original cook of the school, and Lewis Adams, of
the town of Tuskegee, whom Mr. Washington mentions
in ‘Up from Slavery,’ as one of his chief advisers,
all unlettered-before-the-war negroes, his relationship
was always particularly intimate. These
three old men enjoyed the confidence of the white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>people of the town of Tuskegee to an unusual
extent and often acted as ambassadors of good
will between the head of the school and his white
neighbors, when from time to time the latter
showed a disposition to look askance at the rapidly
growing institution on the hill beyond the town.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Another intimate friend of Mr. Washington’s
was Charles L. Diggs, known affectionately on the
school grounds as ‘Old man’ Diggs. The old man
had been body servant to a Union officer in the
Civil War, and after the war had been carried to
Boston, where he became the butler in a fashionable
Back Bay family. When Mr. Washington
first visited Boston, as an humble and obscure
young negro school-teacher, pleading for his struggling
school, he met Diggs, and Diggs succeeded in
interesting his employers in the sincere and earnest
young teacher. When, years afterward, the Institute
had grown to the dignity of needing stewards,
Mr. Washington employed his old friend as
steward of the Teachers’ Home. In all the years
thereafter hardly a day passed when Mr. Washington
was at the school without having some kind
of powwow with ‘Old man’ Diggs regarding some
matter affecting the interests of the school.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To the despair of his family Booker Washington
seemed to go out of his way to find forlorn old
people whom he could befriend. He sent provisions
weekly to an humble old black couple from
whom he had bought a tract of land for the school.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>He did the same for old Aunt Harriet and her deaf,
dumb, and lame son, except that to them he provided
fuel as well. On any particularly cold day,
he would send one or more students over to Aunt
Harriet’s to find out if she and her poor helpless
son were comfortable. Also every Sunday afternoon,
to the joy of this pathetic couple, a particularly
appetizing Sunday dinner unfailingly made
its appearance. And these were only a few of the
pensioners and semipensioners whom Booker
Washington accumulated as he went about his
kindly way.”<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Washington had the capacity of making friends.
He had the gift of friendship. His white friends
were as numerous and staunch as were those of his
own race. His close friendship with such men
as William H. Baldwin, Jr., H. H. Rogers, and
others has already been mentioned. It would be
unfair to him and to them to leave the impression
that their relations were merely those of benefactor
and beggar. They were friends as man to
man. Washington and Roosevelt were friends in
the same way.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would be unfairer still to leave the impression
that Washington’s friends were rich men only and
men in the North only. This was not the case.
Perhaps his strongest friends were in the South,
many of whom were not in the public eye. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>himself records the fact that few men in his entire
career were of such genuine help to him as Captain
Howard, conductor on the W. &#38; A. Railroad. He
did not have an enemy in his own town of
Tuskegee. All through the South were men
whom Washington
counted among his
warmest personal
friends.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Robert Russa Moton, Successor to Booker T. Washington at Tuskegee</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Among his own
people, he was no
less fortunate in
his friendships. He
knew and loved
Moton and Scott
and Banks and Carver
and Fortune
and Scarborough,
and a great host of
others. All these
were his most loyal
and devoted
friends. But none
of these were really
any closer to him than “Old man” Diggs or Rufus
Herron or many a lowly man of Macon County.
There was such sincerity, such a genuineness about
this man that all true men were drawn to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Washington had a keen sense of humor. This is
the reason he was always so even-tempered. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>kept perfect control of himself at all times, and
it was largely his sense of humor that enabled him
to do so. He saw the ridiculous side of things.
He could tell perfectly side-splitting stories, particularly
about his own people. These stories were
always clean and without a sting, and always had
some point to them. He was thoroughly good-natured,
and every one in his presence felt refreshed
and happy by reason of having come in
contact with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had a strong sense of justice. He believed
the problems of the white race as well as those of
the black race must be settled on a basis of justice,
if they were ever to be settled right. The fact
that he constantly spoke of justice and fair dealing
toward the white race showed that there was no
color boundary to this great attribute of his
character. He was not quarrelsome; he did not
hate; he did not lose his temper when he saw injustice
being done to his people. However, he
never did condone such injustice; he was ever
ready to denounce it. He labored unceasingly to
bring about a mutual understanding between the
two races and to inspire in his own race those
principles which he saw with such clear vision.
He said that the negro ought to put more time on
improving his opportunities than crying over his
disadvantages. He believed that the first and most
important thing was for the negro to become well
prepared for the ballot, and by and by he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>get it. He argued that the negroes should work
and save and study and conduct themselves in the
proper way, and that in course of time recognition
would come to them. Sooner or later, the right,
the just thing, would prevail, and the important
thing for the negro was to know he was right.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Booker T. Washington and His Grandchildren</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Washington had the courage to denounce those
members of his own race, particularly some of
the ministers, who did not live as they should.
This was a bold thing to do and brought much
criticism upon him, but, in the long run, it was a
great service to his race and to the whole country.</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of the fact that Washington was a man
of unusual health and strength, his hard work
and the great responsibilities he carried began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>finally to tell on him. But he kept on. He had
wonderful will power, and he would drive himself
to his work from day to day, when other men
would have taken to their beds. He could not
admit to himself that he was losing strength.
Right up to the last, he did an enormous amount
of work.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the early fall of 1915, he went North to deliver
an address before the National Council of
Congregational Churches, held in New Haven,
Connecticut. Although he had not been entirely
well for some time, no one had any idea that he was
seriously ill. Shortly after the address in New
Haven, he collapsed. His friends in New York
City had him removed to St. Luke’s Hospital
there.</p>

<p class='c007'>The physicians made a careful examination and
frankly told him that he was critically ill and could
live but a few hours. When he learned that he
must die, he insisted on starting for home at once.
The doctors told him that he could not go; that
it would mean certain death; that he could not
live through the journey. His reply was: “I was
born in the South, I have lived and labored in the
South, and I expect to die and be buried in the
South.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrangements were hurriedly made for the
journey to Tuskegee. No one believed that he
would reach there alive. One of the doctors had
said that it was “uncanny to see a man up and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>about who ought, by all the laws of nature, to be
dead.” When they reached the railway station
in New York a rolling chair had been provided for
Washington, but he refused to use it and walked
to the train leaning on the arms of his friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the train pulled out and headed for his beloved
Southland, his spirits began to revive, and
he seemed much stronger. He was determined
to beat death in this race. As they journeyed on,
he would ask the names of the stations. When
he was told that they were passing Greensboro,
a triumphant look came into his eyes. Charlotte,
Greenville, Atlanta—he was winning! Finally
they came to Chehaw, the little station five miles
from Tuskegee, the junction point of the railroad
from Tuskegee to the main line.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few more minutes, and he saw the familiar
and much loved scenes of his own Tuskegee.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had won!</p>

<p class='c007'>But his victory was a short one. For when the
sun came up on the next morning, the fourteenth
day of November, 1915, Booker Washington was
dead.</p>
